perception toward e-worksheet based on chiken manure waste treatment projects to 
improve students' creative thinking skills. The method used in this research is mixed 
methods with Sequential Explanatory Design. The data was collected through 
questionnaire, then analyzed by using descriptive analysis. The questionnaires were 
distributed to 14 Science teacher respondents and 127 junior high school students in 
North Metro District. The result shows that teacher have a positive perception toward 
usage of the electronic students' worksheets based on chiken manure waste treatment 
projects. The results showed that 79% of teachers had not used project-based e�worksheets; based on students' response questionnaires, 37% of teachers have given 
project assignments, but the projects were not based on real problems in the 
environment. Environmental problems that occur in North Metro District is the amount 
of chicken manure waste issue that causes pollution to the environment around society’s 
houses. The current worksheets has not completely train students' creative thinking 
skills and that's skills was in low category. Based on the result It can be concluded that 
a e-worksheet based on chiken manure waste treatment projects is needed to improve 
students' creative thinking skills.",archive,2023-05-03 06:57:59,published,51000,public,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/51000,TRUE,3.0,pub,Universitas Mataram,"[{'files': [{'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/548627', 'objectid': 190712, 'mtime': '2023-05-03 04:47:00', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'filename': 'Teachers’ Perception toward Electronic Student Worksheet.pdf', 'hash': 'b66f1e5265ec05898f1116d653958d1d', 'fileid': 548627, 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'filesize': 310203, 'datasetid': 'document'}], 'main': 'Teachers’ Perception toward Electronic Student Worksheet.pdf', 'docid': 190712, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/190712', 'rev_number': 1, 'pos': 1, 'format': 'text', 'placement': 1, 'security': 'public', 'eprintid': 51000, 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'language': 'en'}]",1050-1058,2023-05-03 06:57:59,2023-05-03 06:57:59,958,disk0_bak/00/05/10/00,1970-01-01 00:00:00.000002023,Jurnal Penelitian Pendidikan IPA (JPPIPA),2407-795X,"[{'id': None, 'name': {'lineage': None, 'family': 'Agustin', 'honourific': None, 'given': 'Meliana Sri'}}, {'name': {'family': 'Diawati', 'honourific': None, 'lineage': None, 'given': 'Chansyanah'}, 'id': 'chansyanah.diawati@fkip.unila.ac.id'}, {'name': {'honourific': None, 'family': 'Jalmo', 'lineage': None, 'given': 'Tri'}, 'id': 'tri.jalmo@fkip.unila.ac.id'}]",['FKIP21'],article,,,,,,,,

The results of this study are very useful for knowing the mental models of students, especially in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Students' mental model on understanding covalent bonds in this study, obtained by distributing questions to students, aims to determine the level of understanding of each student by involving three levels of chemical phenomena, namely macroscopically by explaining a brief description of the questions in each question, then sub macroscopic by asking students to describe the Lewis structure, as well as the symbolic level by solving the equation for the formation of compounds. Data were obtained from the covalent bond mental model results and the results of interviews with student representatives.

Then to ensure the validity of the data using technical triangulation and source triangulation followed by data analysis with the research flow, namely identifying problems, determining research designs, determining research roles, determining data collection procedures, data recording, data analysis and verification, and narrating the research results obtained. The results of this research indicate that 54% of teachers have not used the PjBL learning model in learning and the teacher's perception of PjBL is good, but 62% of teachers do not know the PjBL syntax that must be fulfilled in using this learning model. In relation to scientific creativity, teachers do not know what indicators must exist in assessing students' scientific creativity.
