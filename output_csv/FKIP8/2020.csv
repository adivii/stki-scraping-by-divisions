Values contained in pepaccur such as religion, simplicity, cooperation, and politeness can be a reference in behaving in the community and this integration can be an effort to preserve local wisdom that has begun to be abandoned by the Lampung community.

They were then analyzed quantitatively using factor analysis and qualitatively based on the teachers’ answers to learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results demonstrate that Indonesian language teachers have adapted to the implementation of online learning related to the use of technology such as the variety of learning media and educational platforms used as well as TPCK skills. In general, teachers’ TPCK tends to be positive about online learning even though some senior teachers have a negative attitude to the technological aspects.

literary works by a writer is highly influenced by his/her environment. Despite the rigidity of the rules as considered by the people, there are many pesantren-based writers. This study aimed to determine the imagination and creativity of literary texts produced by pesantren-based writers.
Heuristic, hermeneutic, and intertextual reading methods were performed eclectically to analyze the content, values, and language styles in literary texts. Literary texts that become the focus of the study were those written by pesantren-based writers i.e. poems written by Gus Mus, Ahmad Tohari's short
stories, and Habiburrahman El Shirazy's novels. This study found that the imagination and creativity of the literature written by pesantren-based writers tend to be identical with the commitment and quality of the creator's religiosity. It can be implied that the aspects of religiosity and the atmosphere of pesantren that can blow up the imagination and creativity in literary processing can be adopted to support literacy learning and literary processing by public educational institutions outside the pesantren.",2021-08-05 09:08:31,archive,11,3,show,https://ijessr.com/uploads2020/ijessr_03_308.pdf,THE EFFECT OF PESANTREN EDUCATION ON THE CREATIVITY OF PESANTRENBASED WRITERS,International Journal of Education and Social Science Research,,
