InIndonesia, gliphosate has been used for more than 30 years, especially in big plantations such as rubber and oil palm. However, reports about the weed resistance in Indonesia is still very limited. This research aims to test the resistance of Asystasia gangetica, Axonopus compressus, Cyperus kylligia and Eleusine indica from oil palm plantation in South Lampung to glyphosate herbicide. The study was conducted from July to December 2016 in Weed Science Laboratory, University of Lampung. Treatments were arranged in a Split Plot Design, with the origin of the weeds (exposed to glyphosate versus unexposed to glyphosate) as the main plots and dosage of herbicides as the sub plots. Results showed that the Resistance Ratio of Asystasia gangetica, Cyperus kyllingia and Eleusine indica exposed to glyphosate are 3, 6 and 3, respectively, while the Resistance Ratio of Axonopus compresus is 2. Thus it can be concluded that Asystasia gangetica, Cyperus kyllingia and Eleusine indica developing low resistance, whereas Axonopus compresuss has not shown resistance.",['S1'],"Resistance Test of Asystasia gangetica, Axonopus compressus, Cyperus kyllingia and Eleusine indica ï¿¼ from Palm Oil Plantation in South Lampung to Glyphosate Herbicide",28 November 2017,show,conference,7,5564,KONFERENSI DAN SEMINAR NASIONAL XX HIMPUNAN ILMU GULMA INDONESIA (HIGI),submitted,Bogor,

Weed controll using bromacil and diuron herbicides on a pineapple plantation in Central Lampung were done routinely in the last 30 years. After continuosly exposed to herbicides, several appears weeds to be resistant to herbicides application. The possibility of herbiside resistant weeds species to bromacil and diuron is the reason why this study was conducted. This study aims to confirm the occurance of weed resistance to bromacil and diuron herbicides. Research was conducted at the experiment station at Hajimena Village Natar District, South Lampung Province from May to September 2015. Three weed species: Cyperus rotundus (sedge), Dactyloctenium aegyptium (grass) and Asystasia gangetica (broad leave) were used. Two types of active ingredients, namely bromacil and diuron were tested. The experiment was arranged Split Plot Design with six replications. The first factor is the origin of weeds: herbicide exposed weeds and unexposed weeds. The second factor is the type of weed: Cyperus rotundus, Dagtyloctenium aegyptium, and Asystasia gangetica. The third factor is the level of herbicide doses, ie 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 kg a.i / ha. Data homogeneity was tested with Bartlett, whereas the additivity data was tested with Tuckey. To distinguish the middle value treatment, Least Significant Difference Test (BNT) at the 5% significance levelwere used. Results showed that Dactyloctenium aegyptium experienced a low level of resistance to bromacil with LD50 ratio 2.2 times higher and experiencing high levels of resistance to diuron with LD50ratio 261.517 times higher than the unexposed weeds. Cyperus rotundus and Asystasia gangeticawere sensitive to bromacil and diuron herbicides. LD50of bromacil for exposed weeds is 1.7 times higher (sensitive) than unexposed weeds, whereas for diuron, LD50 value ratio is 3.7 times higher (low-level resistance) compared to unexposed for herbicides.
