Merr. & Perry) was conducted from March to May 2016. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications, five branches per experimental unit. Auxin talcum treatment consisting  of 7 level of auxins concentrations, i.e., (in ppm) 0 (control), 2000 IBA, 4000 IBA, 2000 NAA, 4000 NAA, 1000 NAA + IBA 1000 and 2000 IBA + 2000 NAA in the form of talcum-paste were applied in the upper region of the girdled branches prior to being covered with soil medium. The results showed that after two months, all treatments containing NAA, either singly or in combination with IBA produced 100 % rooting, whereas the control treatment was only 22%. The IBA treatments singly at 2000 and 4000 ppm produced 44.4% and 55.6% rooting, respectively. The superiority of NAA upon IBA treatments was also shown by the higher number and length of primary roots as well as earlier root formation. The best treatment for Malay apple rooting was 4000 ppm NAA which produced 33.3 roots, and formed roots three weeks earlier than the control treatment.",6999,published,,,

regenerate the calli into plants, and then evaluate the plants . This research sought to study in vitro plant
regeneration of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) calli and to determine LD50 of gamma ray for
irradiation of embryogenic calli. The research was conducted at The Plant Laboratory, The University
of Lampung, Lampung, Indonesia in 2014. Leafrolls of sugarcane were cultured on callus-inducing
(CI) medium containing MS salts, 30 g L-1 sucrose, 100 mg L-1 myo-inositol, 150 m L-1 coconut water,
0.1 mg L-1 thiamine-HCl, 0.5 mg L-1 pyridoxine-HCl, 0.5 mg L-1 nicotinic acid, 2 mg L-1 glycine, and
3 mg L-1 2,4-D. The embryogenic calli were cultured on shoot-inducing (SI) medium which was the
same as the CI medium, except that the SI medium used 2.5 mg L-1 benzyladenine and no coconut
water. Shoots were rooted on root-inducing (RI) medium containing different concentrations of
indolebutyric acid (IBA) (0, 2, 5, 7.5, 10 mg L-1 ). The RI medium was the same as the SI medium
except for the plant growth regulators. The most effective IBA concentration for rooting of shoots was
5 mgL-1 . Plantlets with highest number of roots showed highest survival rate (68.4%). A radio
sensitivity study by irradiating embryogenic calli with gamma ray (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60
Gy) showed that the LD50 was 17 Gy. The irradiated calli were successfully regenerated into plantlets
and acclimatized to external environment. Results of these studies could be very useful for mutation
breeding of sugarcane.",5371,published,htp:/www.issaas.org/journal/,,

Ramadiana S, Hapsoro D, Yusnita Y. 2018. Morphological variation among fifteen superior robusta coffee clones in
Lampung Province, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 19: 1475-1481. This study aimed to characterize morphological variation among fifteen
superior robusta coffee clones in Lampung Province. The fifteen clones consisted of four clones released by the Indonesian Coffee and
Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI), i.e. ‘BP 409’,‘BP936’, ‘BP939’, ‘SA 237’, together with eleven superior coffee clones selected by
farmers from Tanggamus District (‘Tugino’, ‘Wanto’, ‘Biyadi’, ‘Komari’, ‘Wardi’, ‘Wariso’) and from West Lampung District (‘Tugu
Kuning’, ‘Tugu Hijau', ‘Tugu Biru', ‘Tugu Sari', ‘Lengkong'). Fifteen qualitative and seven quantitative morphological characters were
evaluated in a randomized complete block design with three replicates for each clone,each replication consisted of two plants. From
each plant, four samples were taken from four sides of the plant (north, south, west, and east). It was found that while some
morphological characters exhibited negligible variation among clones, there were significant differences between clones for other
characters. The characters that did not differ significantly between clones were: shapes of leaf base and leaf tip; petiole color; leaf
venation pattern; fruit disk shape; ripe-fruit color; and stipule shape. The characters that varied between clones were shape of leaf lamina
(elliptical vs. lanceolate); fruit shape (round vs. oval); and shape of leaf margins. Morphological variation was also observed in some
quantitative characters: canopy diameter; tree height; stem diameter; leaf length; leaf width; petiole length; stipule length; and number of
primary branches.",9849,published,http:/biodiversitas.mipa.uns.ac.id,DOI: 10.13057/biodiv/d190438,[{'url': 'http:/biodiversitas.mipa.uns.ac.id'}]

on rooting and shoot sprouting in Malay apple cuttings. Cuttings from
superior genotype were collected and treated with (in ppm w/w): 0,
2000 IBA, 4000 IBA, 2000 NAA, 4000 NAA, 1000 IBA+1000 NAA, 2000
IBA+2000 NAA. To record the timing and percentage of rooting, cuttings
were treated with (in ppm w/w) 1000 IBA+1000 NAA or without auxin as
control. The results revealed that application of auxin was significantly
enhanced root formation as shown by the significant increases in
rooting percentage and number of roots. NAA at 2000 or 4000 ppm was
the most effective auxin to promote root formation (100 %, 17.8–25.5
roots per cuttings), followed by NAA+IBA (100 %, 16.8– 9.8 roots per
cuttings) and the least effective was IBA alone (79-100 %, 3.2–7.1 roots
per cutting). The best treatment for rooting and shoot sprouting were
(in ppm) 1000 IBA+1000 NAA, since it produced higher root length,
better root morphology and higher shoot sprouting. It was also found
that a combination of IBA+NAA each at 1000 ppm not only enhanced
root percentage, but also shortened the time for root formation.",6495,published,,,
