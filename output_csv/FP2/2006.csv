Seedling is transferred to main nursery usually from forest or garden. Sugar palm seed germinates slowly 4-6 months after sowing. Scarification is needed before seed sowing. A research was conducted from October 2005 until March 2006 to study morphology of germination and effect of seed scarification on seed germination: (1) sun drying followed by water soaking and (2) shell scouring, (3) no scarification. To study phase of germination with the best growth in main nursery, germinated seed of (1) ring radicle, (2) short 1-2 cm radicle, (3) end swollen radicle, (4) emerging plumule, (5) full open leaf, were transferred in polybag. It was found that seed was germinating through a unique radicle phase and plumule phase. When seedling leave was full opened, the haustorium had absorbed all the endosperm and completely filled the seed cavity. Treatment of sun drying followed by water soaking was significantly increased seed germination (91% germinated) as well as of shell scouring (87% germinated), compared to the control (69% germinated). Transferring seedling of any germination phase was 95% successfully grown in main nursery, but seedling with full opened leaf was only 74%. Transferring would be conducted monthly for seedling of 2 - 4 months old.
