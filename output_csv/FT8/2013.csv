CHARACTERISTIC PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL
INSTITUTIONS","alignment between business strategy and existing information technologies. Developing the required model
is a complex task. A combination of the EA, MDA and SOA concepts can be one of the solutions to
overcome the complexity of building a specific information technology architecture for higher education
institutions. EA allows for a comprehensive understanding of the institution’s main business process while
defining the information system that will assist in optimizing the business process. EA essentially focuses on
strategy and integration. MDA relies on models as its main element and places focuses on efficiency and
quality. SOA on the other hand uses services as its principal element and focuses on flexibility and reuse.
This paper seeks to formulate an information technology architecture that can provide clear guidelines on
inputs and outputs for EA development activities within a given higher education institution. This proposed
model specifically emphasises on WIS development in order to ensure that WIS in higher education
institutions has a coherent planning, implementation and control process in place consistent with the
enterprise’s business strategy. The model will then be applied to support WIS development and
implementation at University of Lampung (Unila) as the case study.
