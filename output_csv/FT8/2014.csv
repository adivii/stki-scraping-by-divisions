service between Service Provider and Customer. Usually this
document contain technical values. Customer needs monitor its
services to ensure the service comply with SLA. Nowadays, energy
efficiency is one of most significant issue. How to provide low cost
and low power for electricity, temperature, network utilization
monitoring was carried out in this paper. Raspberry Pi BCM2835
as a mini computer was used to  ran the services monitoring.
Testbed has been deployed in University of Lampung (Unila) data
centre.  The systems was built base on modified waterfall software
engineering principles. The result presented that the system was
running properly and provided data statistics of electricity,
temperature, and network utilization through an interactive
website  interface that generated by python script. Any peculiar
condition informed immediately to network administrator via sms
or email for properly treatment.  During testbed throughout a
month on June 2014, peak time for daily bandwidth utilization
occurred at working hours, starting from 8 am to 4 pm.
Maximum temperature recorded was 38
0
C and minimum was
15
0
C. For a month there were accumulated total 15.456 hours for
electricity black out. The usage of cpu resource show less than
20%, and memory usage average on 58%.  All data from this
application was used by top IT management, to evaluated
electricity and internet service SLA.

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) has been introduced to overcome future telephony demand. However, these rapid changes encountered some issues, and the most critical is how to provide the services availability and reliability equally to circuit based telephony. Virtualization is widely used not only for hardware efficiency and maintenance, but also for High Availability support. Virtualized environment provides the ability among servers to migrate or replicate into another machine, even when they are running their services, which is known as Live Migration. In this paper, the voice quality of VoIP service when running on the High Availability system in virtualized environment is studied and examined. The objective analysis by using quality of services (QoS) attributes is conducted as well as the subjective analysis using Mean Opinion Score (MOS). The work utilizes Xen® Hypervisor with modified Remus extensions to provide the High Availability environment. Remus approach using checkpoint based is deployed to copy the primary server to the backup server. A range of 40ms – 900ms has been applied as time interval of checkpoint. The results show that the mean jitter is 9,98 ms, packet loss 3,12% and MOS 3.61 for Remus 400ms checkpoint. MOS with different checkpoint time interval is also presented.",20-21 Agustus 2014,Voice Quality of VoIP in High Availability Environment,8,conference,show,"International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI 2014)",10591,published,Yogyakarta,http://journal.portalgaruda.org/index.php/EECSI/article/view/386
