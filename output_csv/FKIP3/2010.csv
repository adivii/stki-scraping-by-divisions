This is because that policy implementation is basically a complex problem involving many supporting 
factors. The purpose of this study is to determine the factors supporting the implementation of decentralization policies on school performance, so we hope to share ideas in order to contribute ideas in improving the school's performance in the implementation of education decentralization policies.  This study uses a quantitative approach, a non-experimental design model
is conducted in junior high school in Bandar Lampung. Samples were taken by first determining the minimum sample using the formula of Cohen (1977) subsequently used proportionate stratified random sampling techniques. Data collected by questionnaires that apply to school principals, teachers, students, and school committees. Then it is analyzed by SEM using the LISREL program.
The research revealed that the school environment, target group policy, school organization and management process is a direct and meaningful support to the implementation of decentralization policies on the school performance. While implementing school policies and school resources are indirectly supporting the
performance of the implementation of decentralization policies in education units
through the process of managing the school organization. Another finding is that the implementers of policies and school resources are a factor for direct support to
the process of managing the school organization. Direct and major supporting factor to the performance of policy implementation decentralization in school is the policy target groups in the sequence followed by the school environment, school organization and management process implementers of school policy.
