The type of research used is research and development that refers to the theory of Borg & Gall. The population in this study included fourth grade students in elementary schools in central Lampung. The sampling technique uses a purposive technique. The sample of this study was fourth grade students, amounting to 44 elementary schools in Central Lampung. Data was collected through questionnaires and tests. The feasibility of the instrument is theoretically based on the assessment of 3 experts with an average of 84.32 very good categories. While the feasibility of the instrument empirically based on the analysis there are 30 decent and quality MCQs from the results of validity, reliability, distinguishing power, level of difficulty, and distractor test. The results of the study showed that the test instruments developed had met the criteria for writing proper and quality test instruments to measure students' knowledge.

The type of research used is research and development that refers to the theory of Borg & Gall (1983). The population in this study were all teachers and fourth grade students in Elementary School 2 in Langkapura , Bandar Lampung City. The samples were taken by using purposive random sampling technique as many as 2 teachers and 58 students in Elementary School 2 in Langkapura. The data is collected through questionnaire sheets and observations. The results of this study indicate that the performance assessment instrument developed based on the feasibility test was stated very good. The results of the validity test stated that the performance assessment instrument was declared valid. Reliability tests on performance assessment instrument were also stated reliability. It was concluded that the performance assessment instrument was valid and reliable for measuring and assessing student performance in both process and product aspects in fourth grade students.
