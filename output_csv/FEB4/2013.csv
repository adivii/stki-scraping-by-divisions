successor from external parties can bring changes to the company through new

Principle learning process using two different method; mathematics-based method and conventional
method, (2) to find an empirical evidence whether an alternatives mathematics-based method is
eligible to be implemented in accounting learning.
This study is a quasi-experimental research with non-equivalent control group design. The subject of
this research is high school student. The participant in total 60 students comes from BPK Penabur
Senior High School as a control group, and Perintis 2 Senior High School Bandarlampung as an
experiment group.
The independent t-test result shows that student learning achievement using mathematics-based
method is statistically equal with conventional method in both competencies; debit or credit
positioning and transaction analyzing. The equality of learning achievement in both group shows that
mathematics-based method is eligible to be implemented in accounting learning process. The
