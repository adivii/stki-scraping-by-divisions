growing media and EC (Electrical Conductivity) nutrient solution on the growth 
and production of melon (Cucumis melo L.). This study used Completely 
Randomized Design Factorial (CRD) with factorial arrangement consisting of 2 
factors, namely the type of planting medium (cocopeat and husk charcoal) and 
the EC value (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) mS/cm, each replicated as much as 3 times to obtain 
30 experimental units. The results showed that cocopeat was a planting medium 
that gave the best response on bases of the parameters of fruit weight and 
sweetness level with an average fruit weight of 2.46 kg, in addition the use of EC 
2 mS/cm and EC 3 mS/cm gave the best response to parameters of fruit weight 
and sweetness level with an average fruit weight of 2.04 kg and 2.05 kg. Based 
on these results, the use of EC 2 ms/cm was chosen as the best treatment, because 
it gives maximum results by spending less resources when compared to EC 3 
mS/cm.

purposes. This research aims to observe the effect of water replacing period and mechanical aeration on the growth of A. microphylla
and the wastewater quality. A 20-gram of A. microphylla biomass was inoculated in a plastic-layered wooden box (50×30×20cm) filled 
with catfish pond wastewater, and then designed treatments were applied for a 12-day experiment. A completely randomized design 
with two factorial arrangements was implemented. The first factor was the period of water replacement consisted of four levels: no 
replacement (E0), once in 2 days (E1), once in 4 days (E2), and once in 6 days (E3). The second factor was mechanical aeration consisted 
of three levels: no mechanical aeration (A0), 12-hour aeration (A1), and 24-hour aeration (A2). Parameters to be observed were Azolla 
biomass and water quality (temperature, pH, turbidity, and ammonium). The data set was analyzed using ANOVA followed by LSD 
multiple comparisons. Results revealed that interaction of the water replacing periods and the mechanical aeration significantly affected 
water quality (temperature, pH, turbidity, ammonium) but was not significant for the yield of A. microphylla biomass. The factor of 
water replacing period alone significantly affected the growth of A. microphylla. The E2 treatment was the most promising option, with 
a biomass yield of 804 g/m2 within 12-day cultivation.
