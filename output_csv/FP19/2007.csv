Purposed sampling was used to collect the samples, and sensory analysis was done by using free choice profiling (FCP) and focus groups method. The Results shows that sensory properties of raw rusip were opaq, thick, and partly mashy.. The colors were grey, brown and very dark brown. The dominant taste were salty, sour, bitter, and the sensation to the tongue was burned and ichy. The aromas formed were fishy, acidic, and rotten. In addition it was also noticed terasi and sardine-like aromas.",Jurnal Teknologi Industri & Hasil Pertanian,"[{'name': {'given': 'Dyah', 'lineage': None, 'honourific': None, 'family': 'Koesoemawardani'}}]",ISSN 1410-3044 (print) and ISSN 2304-4399 (online),disk0/00/00/22/89,2007-09-01,article,['FP19'],pub,2.0,Jurusan Teknologi Hasil Pertanian Unila,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/2289,none,TRUE,2017-06-02 02:26:54,994,36-39,2017-06-02 02:26:54,,,,,

The best result was soursoup leather by adding 0,8 % seaweed. The analysis of physicochemical parameter were moisture
