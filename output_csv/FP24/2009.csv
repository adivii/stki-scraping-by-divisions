Intensifi ed cultivation of physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) could raise the importance of
plant diseases. T e objectives of this research were to diagnose diseases occurring on physic nut
in Lampung Province and to determine their intensity. Field observation was conducted in four
districts: South Lampung, Tanggamus, Bandarlampung, and Tulang Bawang. Disease intensity,
whether expressed as disease incidence or severity, was recorded from plant samples determined by
making diagonal lines across the fi eld on which fi ve observation spots were made. On each spot, fi ve
plant samples were observed. Specimens were also collected and placed individually in plastic bags
for laboratory observation. T e diseases found on physic nut in Lampung Province were cercospora
leaf spot, alternaria leaf spot, fusarium wilt, and bacterial wilt. In addition, leaf malformation
fi rst thought to be viral disease was commonly found in many locations. Further mechanical
transmission failed to produce similar symptom on tested plants and higher population of mites
were found on malformed leaves than that in normal leaves. Based on the disease distribution and
intensity, the most likely threatening disease in physic nut cultivation is bacterial wilt. Fusarium
also caused wilt, but it was only found in one subdistrict with low incidence.

The study was done in Penumangan Lampung from June 2007 to July 2008. Seven sites were observed on the incidence of white rot of indicator plants (cassava) . Physical, chemical, and biological soil characters were correlated and regressed with white rot incidence. The results showed that there were correlation between white rot incidence and soil characters such as pH KCl, number of fungal genus (fungal diversity), Ca+, total cation, CEC, and saturation base. Ion Ca+, total cation, saturation base correlated positively with white rot incidence, on the contrary, fungal diversity, cation exchange capacity, and pH KCl correlated negatively with white rot incidence. Thus, efforts to increase fungal diversity, cation exchange capacity, and pH (in acidic soil) could be used as basic strategies to develope intergrated  control of white rot disease.","The corelations between White Rot (Rigidoporus lignosus L.) incidence and  soil characters of rubber ecosystem in Penumangan Baru, Lampung.",,9.0,9,show,810,published,380,2016-10-21 03:53:03,2016-10-17 14:29:47,149-157,pub,2.0,,,"[{'rev_number': 4, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/704', 'pos': 1, 'format': 'text', 'files': [{'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/4823', 'objectid': 704, 'filename': 'JHPT Tropika 09-2-149-157-September 2009.pdf', 'hash': '1e4a3b1baae30cfa2775044e74f00b5f', 'mtime': '2016-10-15 01:13:39', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'fileid': 4823, 'filesize': 2110967, 'datasetid': 'document'}], 'main': 'JHPT Tropika 09-2-149-157-September 2009.pdf', 'docid': 704, 'content': 'published', 'language': 'en', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'placement': 1, 'security': 'public', 'eprintid': 810}]",public,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/810,TRUE,article,['FP24'],Jurnal Hama dan Penyakit Tumbuhan Tropika,1411-7525,"[{'id': 'joko.prasetyo@fp.unila.ac.id', 'name': {'lineage': None, 'family': 'Prasetyo', 'honourific': None, 'given': 'Joko'}}, {'id': 'titik.nuraeny@fp.unila.ac.id', 'name': {'honourific': None, 'family': 'Aeny', 'lineage': None, 'given': 'Titik Nur'}}, {'name': {'given': 'Radix', 'family': 'Suharjo', 'honourific': None, 'lineage': None}, 'id': 'radix.suharjo@fp.unila.ac.id'}]",2009-09-01 00:00:00.000000000,disk0/00/00/08/10,808.0,,,,,,

(former Erwinia chrysanthemi). It has been recorded as the pathogen, though, the species assignment of the organism in the genus Dickeya had not yet been confirmed. The isolates showed biochemical properties similar to those of E. chrysanthemi bv.1 (= pv. dianthicola), which is now presumed to be D. dianthicola. Through sequence analysis of the 16SrDNA, rpoD and gyrB genes, the potato isolates were allocated within a cluster together with D. dianthicola. Cross inoculation experiment of the potato isolates and a carnation isolate of D. dianthicola showed that both of the isolates can infect potato and carnation, having a tendency of stronger virulence against the original hosts. Therefore, the potato isolates were identified as D. dianthicola. Comparative genetic studies on related Dickeya strains isolated in Japan revealed that they are heterogeneous and some of them could not be allocated to existing Dickeya species.",Identification of Dickeya sp. isolated from bacterial stem rot of potato,http://www.ppsj.org/index_en.html,75.0,9,show,2756,completed,579,2018-05-28 03:26:35,2017-06-02 06:49:04,272-272,pub,3.0,,The phytopathological society of japan,"[{'eprintid': 2756, 'placement': 1, 'security': 'public', 'language': 'en', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'main': 'japan jurnal phyto vol 75 No 3.pdf', 'docid': 2616, 'files': [{'fileid': 18882, 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'mtime': '2017-06-01 06:47:19', 'filename': 'japan jurnal phyto vol 75 No 3.pdf', 'hash': '3c6286d9c7375c46f352e86f5fcbcae0', 'datasetid': 'document', 'filesize': 3382492, 'objectid': 2616, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/18882'}], 'pos': 1, 'format': 'text', 'rev_number': 1, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/2616'}]",public,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/2756,TRUE,article,['FP24'],Japanese Journal of Phytopathology,0031-9473,"[{'name': {'family': 'Suharjo', 'honourific': None, 'lineage': None, 'given': 'Radix'}}, {'name': {'given': 'T', 'honourific': None, 'family': 'Hayakawa', 'lineage': None}}, {'name': {'given': 'H', 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Tsujimoto', 'honourific': None}}, {'name': {'given': 'K', 'honourific': None, 'family': 'Nomura', 'lineage': None}}, {'name': {'lineage': None, 'honourific': None, 'family': 'Sawada', 'given': 'H'}}, {'name': {'given': 'Y', 'family': 'Takikawa', 'honourific': None, 'lineage': None}}]",2009-08-01 00:00:00.000000000,disk0/00/00/27/56,,,,,,,

However, the infestation was less severe in areas farther away north or west from the city. No northward infestation was found in Wated Village and Bandarjaya Village (Central Lampung District) nor was it westward in Gadingrejo Subdistrict and Pringsewu Subdistrict (Pringsewu District). The population build-up, invasion, and geographical spread of the mealybug were thought to be associated with the symbiotic activity of either one or more of the six ant genera. This study also recorded that 31 plant genera (other than Carica) of 20 families were found infested by the mealybug, including 5 plant genera that have been previously reported (Hibiscus, Citrus, Capsicum, Persea, and Mangifera). It is clearly shown from this study that such important food crops as Zea (corn), Glycine (soybean), and Manihot (cassava) were also found severely and massively infested by the papaya mealybug.","Infestation of the Papaya Mealybug in Home Yard Plants in Bandarlampung, Indonesia",,,9,show,906,,1054,2016-10-26 03:33:54,2016-10-26 03:33:54,81-92,pub,,,,"[{'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'language': 'en', 'eprintid': 906, 'placement': 1, 'security': 'public', 'pos': 1, 'format': 'text', 'rev_number': 1, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/802', 'docid': 802, 'main': 'Papaya mealybug in Lampung - Indonesia (Susilo - Purnomo - Swibawa 2009).pdf', 'files': [{'datasetid': 'document', 'filesize': 2488646, 'fileid': 5591, 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'mtime': '2016-10-25 06:24:55', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'filename': 'Papaya mealybug in Lampung - Indonesia (Susilo - Purnomo - Swibawa 2009).pdf', 'hash': '48ca9da7f223189bdb615f368dc6b457', 'objectid': 802, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/5591'}]}]",public,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/906,TRUE,conference_item,['FP24'],,,"[{'name': {'given': 'FX', 'honourific': None, 'family': 'Susilo', 'lineage': None}, 'id': 'fx.susilo@fp.unila.ac.id'}, {'name': {'honourific': None, 'family': 'Purnomo', 'lineage': None, 'given': '.'}, 'id': 'purjomo@yahoo.com'}, {'id': 'gede.swibawa@fp.unila.ac.id', 'name': {'given': 'I Gede', 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Swibawa', 'honourific': None}}]",1970-01-01 00:00:00.000002009,disk0/00/00/09/06,,,speech,3rd International Meeting for the Development of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in Asia and Africa,Bandarlampung - INDONESIA,7-9 December 2009,conference
