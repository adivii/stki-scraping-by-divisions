Efficacy of Verticillium lecanii to prevent the incidence of rust on coffee leaf disks in the laboratory. In the coffee
plantations, Verticillium colonies often develop on the uredium and urediospores of H. vastatrix causing coffee leaf rust.
The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of V. lecanii to prevent disease incidence on coffee leaf disks in
the laboratory. Leaf samples showing lesions with H. vastatrix uredospores and whitish mycelium expected to be
Verticillium were taken from two coffee fields at Sumberjaya Subdistrict, West Lampung, and transported in ice chest to the
laboratory. Verticillium was isolated with a sterilized needle and grown on PDA-lactic acid media (PDA-L). Verticillium
was identified as V. lecanii as reported previously. In the first test, each of two isolates of V. lecanii was grown on media
containing yeast extract, malt, peptone-water, and dexytrose (YMPD) to produce conidia. In the second and third tests,
each of five antagonistic isolates was grown on PDA-L. Suspension with 107 conidia ml-1 was sprayed into leaf disks and
then the disks were inoculated with urediospores (104 ml-1). In the first test, disease incidence was significantly reduced.
However, in the second and third tests, the disease was not significantly reduced.

The pest problems on golf course can be indicated by its characteristics of nematode community.  Survey on nematodes community at PGS Golf Course Bandar Lampung was conducted from March to December 2004.  The objective was to study the characteristics of nematode community in the part of golf courses hole (green, collar, apron, and fairway).  Soil samples were taken from five holes each of it consists of green, collar, apron, and fairway, respectiveley.  Nematodes extraction was done in Laboratory of Arthropod Pest, Department of Plant Protection University of Lampung.   The result showed that at least 50 nematodes genera of 28 families inhabit PGS. The number of plant parasitic nematode genera was higher than the free-living one.  The characteristic of nematodes community on green and collar was different than on faiway. Nematode
abundance and diversity on green and collar were higher than on fairway.  Based on abundance of nematode feeding group,
maturity index of free-living nematodes (MI) and that of plant parasitic nematodes (PPI), green and collar part seemed to be more favorable to plant parasitic nematodes than free-living nematodes. The contrary happened for fairway.  Four most dominant genera of plant parasitic nematodes on PGS golf course were Helicotylenchus, Hoplolaimus, Criconemella, and Xiphinema.
