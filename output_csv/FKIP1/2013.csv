This study aims at describing the functions of borrowing from English in Indonesian texts of sport domains. The data of linguistic units borrowed from English, both loanwords and metaphorical code-switches, in Indonesian texts of sport domains were taken from the sport articles of an Indonesian national newspaper in 2010—2011, and from three sport books, each concerns with techniques of playing sports, sport education, and sport for health. The linguistic units borrowed were analyzed their pragmatic functions based on their external factors, namely, their speech components. The research results show that the linguistic units borrowed from English hold all kinds of pragmatic functions proposed by Jakobson (1973: 54—57) in the texts of sport written in Indonesian. The results imply that even though the functions expressed in the linguistic units borrowed from English are based on some reasons, not all of the functions need to be expressed in those borrowed linguistic units.",['PE'],http://ejournal.uin-suka.ac.id/adab/Adabiyyat/article/view/675,FUNGSI PINJAMAN DARI BAHASA INGGRIS DALAM TEKS BERBAHASA INDONESIA PADA RANAH OLAHRAGA,show,8,12,article,['FKIP1'],"[{'id': 'nurweniari@gmail.com', 'name': {'honourific': None, 'family': 'Nurweni', 'lineage': None, 'given': 'Ari'}}]",25491482,Adabiyyat Jurnal Bahasa dan Sastra,SK Akreditasi No: 64a/DIKTI/Kep/2010,disk0/00/00/33/14,1970-01-01 00:00:00.000002013,2017-06-12 02:43:14,717,2017-06-12 02:43:14,56-82,Fakultas Adab dan Ilmu Budaya UIN Sunan Kalijaga,"[{'files': [{'datasetid': 'document', 'filesize': 71087, 'fileid': 23037, 'mime_type': 'application/xml', 'mtime': '2017-06-04 07:50:58', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'filename': 675, 'hash': '285f3c147d3733321ee8d1942b65d772', 'objectid': 3208, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/23037'}], 'main': 675, 'docid': 3208, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/3208', 'rev_number': 3, 'format': 'text', 'pos': 1, 'security': 'public', 'placement': 1, 'eprintid': 3314, 'content': 'published', 'mime_type': 'application/xml', 'language': 'en'}]",pub,1,TRUE,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/3314,public,,

2,27879,published,,2021-02-15 01:19:47,archive,"It has been argued that a word is best learned from its context, showing the importance of learning various lexical combinations occurring in sentences. Several major variations of lexical combination can be identifies, each exhibiting varying degrees of cohesiveness. One of the famous lexical combinations is called collocations. Collocation is defined as the co-occurrence of words in a text. The term ‘collocation’ is generally used in discussing the nature of lexis and its relation to grammar (Nation, 2001). Even though lexis is usually contrasted with grammar, they sometimes have a close relationship with each other.
This study investigates the pattern of collocation of the high frequency words occurring in two corpora, economics and academic corpora. The collocational behavior of these words in both economics and academic texts is compared. It was found that the difference in the richness of collocations in the two corpora is simply due to the difference in the text types of these two corpora. In the economics corpus which consists of texts on one topic, there is more opportunity for significant collocations to be repeated. The chance for the same collocates to occur frequently is greater than in the Academic corpus. In the Academic corpus which consists of many differen texts, there is smaller chance for the same collocates to occur repeatedly. There are very few collocates in the Academic corpus which do not occur in the Economics corpus. However, only a small number of collocates occur very frequently in both corpora.

The theoretical bases use for the application of multimedia in second language teaching is on the basis of comprehensible input and comprehensible output, two terms which have been discussed and analyzed in second language acquisition research for the last two decades.
Use of multimedia in this article is on two types of language skills: receptive and productive skills covering the four language skills listening, reading, speaking, and writing. Practical examples of the use of multimedia is directed toward using it by learners and by teachers as learning faciltators. A wide range of internet use for university students is given in a more detailed perspective.
