DNA fragment encoding mature GH protein of common carp (mCcGH) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and PCR products were then ligated into pCold I to generate pCold I-mCcGH protein expression vector. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pCold I-mCcGH was cultured in the 2xYT medium at 15 °C for 24 hours and protein production was induced by isopropyl-beta-thio galactopyranoside (IPTG). The inclusion bodies containing rGH protein from E. coli transformants were isolated by sonication method and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The result showed that rGH with molecular weight of about 25 kDa was obtained. Common carp juveniles with average body weight of 5.2±0.4 g were intramuscularly injected once a week for 4 weeks with rGH protein solution from 1 μg bacterial cells per gram fish body weight. The result showed that juveniles fish injected with rGH grew 106.56% higher than control. This result indicated that rGH produced in E. coli BL21 possessed biological activity and it may be useful to improve growth of aquaculture species.,['SH'],http://journal.ipb.ac.id/index.php/jai/index,Production and bioactivity test of recombinant protein common carp growth hormone,show,8,10
