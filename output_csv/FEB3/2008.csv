According to
psychological research, less informed individuals may suffer from overconfidence.
Empirical research shows that investors suffer from transaction losses due to
overconfidence. This current research is an experimental research project that addresses
these issues. According to the research design, all investors are classified into three
groups based on their scores of overconfidence, namely the less informed investors, the
rational (average) investors, and the more informed investors. In order to observe the
responses of the groups of investors when they receive valuable information, the research
employs four different types of treatments consisting of the condition of no market
information, the provision of guidance of security prediction, the good news and the bad
news.
 The research demonstrates that the less informed investors are inclined to assess the
precision of their knowledge and information excessively so that they produce a higher
mean of prediction and price errors than those of the more informed investors in all
experimental market sessions, except in the market session of good news. The phenomenon
indicates that less informed investors conduct a self deceptive behavior. The result of the
research also shows that although the less informed investors have higher mean of
prediction or price errors, they have a chance to gain profit as long as they are able to
deliver the predicted value of the security accurately which is closer to the market price
that reflects the expected price of the majority of the market players.
