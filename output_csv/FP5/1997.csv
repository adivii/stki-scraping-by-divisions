The experimental units were arranged in 3 x 3 factorial in Randomized Complete Block Design.  The first factor was planting space which consist of 3 (three) levels: 1m x 0,5m, 1m x 0,75m, and 1m x 1m planting spaces.  The second factor was stem cutting height which consists of 3 (three) levels: at 5m, 55m, and 105m above the ground.  The analysis of variance and orthogonal contrasts were used to compare treatment effects.  The objectives of this study were to know the effect of planting spaces and stem cutting at different height of C. callothyrsus on the wood and leaves production, and then to choose the planting spaces and/or stem cutting height which gave the best production o wood and leaves.  The result of analysis indicate that each tested treatment is significant to the length of bud, the stem diameter, the weight of fresh wood, the weight of fresh leaf, the weight of dry wood and leaf per tree, the weight of dry wood and leaf per meter square area, and to the number of bud.  Furthermore the planting space 1m x 0,5m and the stem cutting height at 105m above the ground is able to produce a good wood and leaf.  The production of C. callothyrsus at the 6 month after stem cutting (the 12 month old) by 1m x 0,5m planting space and the stem cutting height at 105cm above the ground namely 544.968 gram per meter square dry wood and leaf.  The interaction of planting space and stem cutting height treatments is significant to the production of C. callothyrsus.",['SD'],archive,2020-03-16 02:13:55,disk0/00/01/86/99,1997,"[{'name': {'given': '.', 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Indriyanto', 'honourific': None}, 'id': 'indriyanto.1962@fp.unila.ac.id'}]",0854-7394,Jurnal Ilmiah Ilmu-Ilmu Pertanian,['FP5'],article,TRUE,public,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/18699,"[{'eprintid': 18699, 'security': 'public', 'placement': 1, 'language': 'en', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'main': 'Indriyanto (1997)_Pengaruh jarak tanam & tinggi pemangkasan.pdf', 'docid': 31875, 'files': [{'filesize': 2899192, 'datasetid': 'document', 'mtime': '2020-03-14 20:00:02', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'hash': '703bfda8e6c0a1613026f904af534896', 'filename': 'Indriyanto (1997)_Pengaruh jarak tanam & tinggi pemangkasan.pdf', 'fileid': 157027, 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/157027', 'objectid': 31875}], 'format': 'text', 'pos': 1, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/31875', 'rev_number': 1}]","Bidang Ilmu-ilmu Pertanian, Badan Kerjasama Perguruan Tinggi Negeri Indonesia Bagian Barat",1,pub,20-25,2020-03-16 02:13:55,2020-03-16 02:13:55,995
