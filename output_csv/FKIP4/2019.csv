Recent researches on how to make an alternative solution in the form of STEM learning methods and strategies to address the challenges of the 21st century and 4IR technology had been widely investigated. However, the implementation in the term of integrated-STEM field. The implementation of integrated STEM was still fragmented so that the essence of a whole STEM meaning had not been described. Recent studies oriented to the development of learning strategies had not emphasized the makerspace concept, even though a good understanding of makerspace concept was the start point in implementing integrated-STEM essence. Makerspace in STEM is the deliberate positioning of student learning in contexts that require the drawing together of skills and knowledge from the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to create, construct, and critique a product or artefact. The research presented in this paper describes a type of STEM makerspace that was defined by its purpose: to foster Student’s 21st Century Skills in  4IR technologies and 21st century challenges. This approach is innovative into STEM education. A new model of STEM makerspace that is currently being validated in an extended, funded project framed this research that involved secondary students in Indonesia. A large set of qualitative data was collected, this paper reports on the progress and reflections of the teacher education students, and shares insights into their personal learning and development as teachers. A quasi-experimental study  in Heat transfer STEM makerspace was conducted. Results of samples paired  t-test showed Sig.(2-tailed) 0.000 which indicated that there were differences in results pretest and posttest when STEM makerspace was implemented with the effect size data was in a high category.",['LB'],archive,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to design a hypothetical model of an inquiry-basedSTEM learning strategy design that could systematically guide instructors or designers in creating an appropriate learning activities oriented to 21st century skills. Before conducting the strategy design, we do need assessment survey teacher in Lampung Indonesia to describe teachers’  perceptions about STEM education and career as a starting point for designing a strategy that could follow up the 21st century learning framework. We conduct a cross-sectional non-experimental descriptive survey approach using quetionnaire to 75 teachers in Lampung, Indonesia.

This contamination is due to the issue in controlling temperature during the media sterilization for growing the fungus (bag-log). This suboptimal sterilization causes unwanted bacteria and spores to grow. To reduce the amount of contamination, the purpose of this study was to demonstrate and evaluate the temperature distribution using one convection pipe with diameter of 6 and 8 cm. The fuel used for this sterilization process is rice husk. Sterilization itself aims to kill other unwanted bacteria and spores on the bag-log. Sterilization was done by traditional steaming bag-log drums arranged in four rows upwards for 6 hours. Convection pipes were built in drums. The steamer was done by performing two retrievals of data. From the experiment results, the use of convection pipe of 8 cm was better than the convection pipe of 6 cm. This is shown from the amount of fungal contamination in convection pipes were less in 8.

The result of the research shows that the laboratory worksheet is proper to use aslearning resource that validity average is 84.25% are considered theoretically feasible and student response average is 96.40% is considered very good.

The data were analyzed using rasch model and the item reliability index was 0.89, the reliability index of the respondents was 0.91, and Cronbach's alpha value was 0.93, which meant the reliability of the questions obtained was good. The results of the students 'answer patterns are six criteria: understanding concepts, misconceptions (+), misconceptions (-), misconceptions, guessing / lack of confidence / luck, and not understanding the concepts used to diagnose learners' understanding in measuring high-level thinking skills ( HOTS) which is integrated with the dimensions of factual, conceptual and procedural knowledge. Misconceptions that occur in students have three criteria, namely misconception (+), misconception (-), and misconception, and the most experienced by students is a misconception (-) in the C4 cognitive level which is integrated with the conceptual knowledge dimension on the substance characteristic material . This misconception (-) can be reduced through the correct concept with the right reasons.",['LB1603'],archive,,,,https://doi.org/10.30595/Dinamika/v11i2.5053,,

The research method was descriptive method.The population in this study were ten junior high school teachers and seventy five junior high school students from five different schools. The data collection used questionnaires and data analysis techniques using percentages. The results showed that the teachers perception of learning using interactive multimedia in the aspect of implementation was low category, because teachers still use books and students worksheet. Teachers perceptions of scientific literacy aspects are low, but teachers have tried to apply them in learning. Furthermore, teachers perceptions of students self efficacy in category “medium”. Students' perceptions for aspects of learning using Multimedia interactive (MMI) and scientific literacy were still low, but on aspect of students self efficacy in the “high” category. Then, the percentage of students requirements of using MMI in learning in “high” category. It can be concluded that using MMI to improve students sains literacy and students self efficacy.","['LB', 'LB1603']",archive,,,,,,[{'url': 'http://digital.library.ump.ac.id/301/'}]
