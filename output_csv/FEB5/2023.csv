Fifteen selected expert respondents filled out this questionnaire. The results of this study indicate that the strategy for developing Mutun Beach tourism is 1) Marketing Mutun Beach tourism on platforms, websites, and other social media so that it can develop quickly and be known by many tourists, as well as maximize existing facilities and infrastructure. 2) Recruiting human resources who are competent in their fields and optimizing existing infrastructure facilities so that they are maintained and maintained in the future. 3) Improving cleanliness and maintaining tourist attractions such as tourist attractions so that they still look beautiful and memorable for tourists to come back. 4) Tighten supervision of tourists who swim by involving residents who understand the surrounding conditions.",archive,2023-03-31 07:43:27,"[{'type': 'pub', 'url': 'https://jonedu.org/index.php/joe/article/view/1828'}]",5.0,7,show,https://jonedu.org/index.php/joe/article/view/1828,Strategi Efektif Pengembangan Pariwisata Pantai Mutun Sebagai Wisata Bahari di Kabupaten Pesawaran Provinsi Lampung,published,49475,,,,

The conflict that started at the end of February is ongoing, potentially disrupting economic and trade performance in the global sector, including Indonesia. The battle has the opportunity to increase some food commodity prices, thus hampering the total imports carried out. In addition, other leading commodities (non-oil and gas) such as gold, oil, and coal will also experience significant turmoil due to the conflict that has continued to heat up recently. The study provides an overview of the systemic impact on Indonesia's economic conditions by predicting the short-term possibilities. This study investigates the Russia-Ukraine conflict's initial estimate of the net import value of the two countries and other trading partners. This study uses independent variables, namely oil and gas commodities and gold prices over eleven years (2000-2021). Error Correction Model (ECM) is an analytical method used in this study. This research expects to give an overview to academia, business, industry, and the government in anticipating Indonesia's economic and trade performance to the crisis in Russia and Ukraine.

Openness of trade can provide opportunities for each country to export goods whose factors of production use abundant resources and import goods whose production will be expensive if produced domestically.

menggunakan analisis regresi data panel, dilakukan dengan cara melihat pengaruh kelimpahan sumber daya
alam terhadap pertumbuhan ekonomi. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kelimpahan sumber daya alam yang
menggunakan danabagi hasil pertambangan dan migas berpengaruh positif dan tidak signifikan berpengaruh
terhadap pertumbuhan ekonomi. Hal tersebut membuktikan bahwa fenomena Natural Resource Curse tidak
terjadi pada tingkat provinsi di Pulau Sumatera pada periode 2014-2019. Namun berdasarkan nilai RRCI,
menunjukkan bahwa provinsi dengan sumber daya alam tambang yang lebih kaya cenderung menghadapi

This research aims to find out the long-term and short-term effects of the oil price variable on the exchange rate, as well as the variables of foreign 
exchange reserves, relative money supply, relative GDP, and interest rates relative to the exchange rate in Indonesia. The analytical method used is the 
error correction model (ECM). This study’s results indicate a significant adverse effect between the variables of foreign exchange reserves, relative 
GDP, and relative interest rates on exchange rates in the long term and short term. There is an insignificant positive relationship between oil prices 
and the exchange rate in the long term and a significant positive relationship in the short term. There is a negligible negative effect between the money 
supply relative to the exchange rate in the long term and an essential negative relationship in the short term.

Furthermore, it will be seen how the contribution of the two existing periods of the term of banking to

years to test these relationships and analyzed accordingly. Besides descriptive analysis, correlations, and 
regression, mediation analysis was carried out using Vector Autoregression (VAR). VAR is a model that can 
analyze the interdependence relationship between time series variables. The results proved that profits, credits
