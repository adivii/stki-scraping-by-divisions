of Modified Cassava Starch and Flour by Integrated
Processing Technology",https://www.hrpub.org/download/20230228/FST2-11130322.pdf,"A wide range of cassava derivative products,
such as starch and flour, was applied in various food
products. Therefore, this research investigated the
processing techniques of cassava starch and flour, each
with the aim of extracting the superior properties and
characteristics for a specific end product. By modifying the
existing procedures with integrated cassava processing
technology, the production of both products could occur
simultaneously. This was renewal processing as unified
technology, which implied that one single processing could
generate two products at a time. In addition to producing a 
superior characteristic, the integrated method also saved
time and cost. In this research, two factors of Completely
Randomized Design (CRD) were used in three replications.
The first factor was soaking in the flowing
water/continuous system (P1) and static water/batch
system (P2). The second was the fermentation time (T) of
24 hours (T1), 48 hours (T2), and 72 hours (T3).
Furthermore, the steps conducted include weighing, brown
and white skin peeling, washing, size reduction, immersion
in continuous and batch systems, fermentation for 24, 48,
and 72 hours, refining/milling, and starch extraction,
followed by the pressing process. The existing slurry was
deposited for 8 hours, then the starch was extracted. The 
starch and flour were dried in the oven at 60o
C until
reaching a maximum moisture content of 13%. They were
milled and sifted in a 100-mesh sieve. The results showed
that the spontaneous fermentation process in the integrated
cassava technology produces the superior characteristics of
modified cassava starch and flour to the point of being
recommended as a model. The yield whiteness value, and
swelling power (g/g) of modified cassava starch and flour
range from 9.0-12.5% and 30.58-35.44%, 91.34-94.04, and
90.41-91.56, as well as 13.28-14.35 and 14.43-17.44 (w/w),
respectively. The amylograph characteristics of the starch
paste included longer fermentation, increasing pasting
temperature, increasing maximum viscosity (value > 600),
decreasing breakdown, and increasing setback value.
Meanwhile, for flour paste, it includes longer fermentation,
increasing pasting temperature, decreasing peak viscosity
(value > 500), decreasing breakdown, and increasing
setback value.",['S1'],2023-05-10 00:55:23,archive,published,51328,public,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/51328,"[{'language': 'en', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'placement': 1, 'security': 'public', 'eprintid': 51328, 'rev_number': 1, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/217374', 'pos': 1, 'format': 'text', 'files': [{'mtime': '2023-05-09 15:18:45', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'hash': '4284ea18e4c62ec469e479e4fea7ae5d', 'filename': '1_FST2-11130322_Physicochemical_Characteristics_and_Pasting_Properties.pdf[1].pdf', 'fileid': 577459, 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'filesize': 865453, 'datasetid': 'document', 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/577459', 'objectid': 217374}], 'main': '1_FST2-11130322_Physicochemical_Characteristics_and_Pasting_Properties.pdf[1].pdf', 'docid': 217374}]",Horizon Research Publishing(HRPUB),pub,2023-05-10 00:55:23,565,2023-05-10 00:55:23,DOI: 10.13189/fst.2023.110102,disk0_bak/00/05/13/28,2023,"[{'id': 'surfianawrag@polinela.ac.id', 'name': {'honourific': None, 'family': 'Surfiana', 'lineage': None, 'given': 'Surfiana'}}, {'id': 'udinha65@gmail.com', 'name': {'lineage': None, 'honourific': None, 'family': 'Hasanudin', 'given': 'Udin'}}, {'name': {'given': 'Siti', 'family': 'Nurdjanah', 'honourific': None, 'lineage': None}, 'id': 'siti.nurdjanah@fp.unila.ac.id'}, {'name': {'family': 'Utomo', 'honourific': None, 'lineage': None, 'given': 'Tanto Pratondo'}, 'id': 'tanto.utomo@fp.unila.ac.id'}]",['FP4'],other
