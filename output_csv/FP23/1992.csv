It is assumed that results from such binary exchange systems can be extrapolated to three-ion (ternary) systems by using appropriate equations. However, such an evaluation is rarely carried out. This study investigated the influence of added ammonium (NH4) on potassium quantity-intensity (Q/I) relationships representing adsorption and desorption by soil samples taken at the 0 to 15-cm and 15 to 30-cm depths for three soils obtained from northern Kentucky. The soils were Eden silty clay (fine, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs), Lowell silty clay loam (fine, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs), and Nicholson silt loam (fine, mixed, mesic Typic Fragiudalfs). These soils have each failed to show K-fertilization response. It was shown that the Q/I plot components, labile K (ExK0), activity ratio of K at equilibrium (ARK0) and linear potential buffering capacity of K (PBCK) were each affected by added NH4. The addition of NH4 caused an increase in the quantity of labile K for all three soils at both depths. ARK0 was also higher in the presence of NH4, but the PBCK was lower. The amount of K extracted with 0.1 mol L-1 BaCl2 was closer to the amount of K estimated from the y-intercept of the Q/I plot of the apparent high-affinity sites than to the amount of K extracted with neutral NH4C2H3O2. Finally, K adsorption was not readily reversible. The quantity of K desorbed was higher in the presence of added NH4 than in its absence. The availability of K in these soils should be enhanced by the presence of ammonium in the soil solution.",['S1'],archive,published,1189,Williams and Wilkins,5,pub,[{'type': 'http://www.loc.gov/loc.terms/relators/AUT'}],2016-11-17 03:51:03,['University of Lampung'],2016-11-17 03:51:03,10.1097/00010694-199211000-00005,1992-11-01,['FP23'],article

The applied N-fertilizer (urea) was hydrolyzed to NH4-N and subsequently nitrified resulting in pulsed inputs of NH4-N and N03-N in soil, which affected the denitrification and N2 fixation processes. The actual denitrification process was not substantial except for the short period following the simultaneous application of FYM and urea. At this time, the leyel of N03-N in soils was high together with the large number of denitrifiers. The denitrification rates increased ranging from 1.00 to 3.56 kg N20-N ha-ld-l  by the application of FYM. The positive effect of the long-term application of FYM of N2 Fixation was observed within the application rate of 20 t FYMIha, although a larger number of N2 fixers was observed with higher application rates. The maximum rates of N2 Fixation ranged from 13.0 to 21.0g N2-N/hald. In the control plot the fixation was less than 9.0 G N2-N ha-1d-1.  N2 fixation was inhibited by the pulsed input of NH4-N in soil originating from urea, as anticipated, but the inhibitory effect lasted for an unexpectedly long period of time, even when the NH4-N Level in soil decreased to the original.",['S1'],archive,published,1248,Taylor & Francis,4,pub,,2016-11-22 01:02:40,['University of Lampung'],2016-11-22 01:02:41,,1992-08-01,['FP23'],article
