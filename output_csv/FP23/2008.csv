The results showed that the soil temperatures of the surface layers under cassava bagasse and black polyethylene film mulches slightly increased with the increase in air temperature, while rice husk and cassava peel mulches decreased the heat convection into soil surface by retaining the incoming solar radiation heat within mulches layers. However, soil temperature regimes were greatly ameliorated by the mulching materials and that enhanced water absorption by pineapple, therefore the total wet biomasses and yields were improved.
