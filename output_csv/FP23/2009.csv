This is because land use chance and the farmers cultivated coffee based farms on steep land without adequate soil and water conservation technologies. Land degradation caused by erosion was generally greater than the local tolerable soil loss. Erosion on site washed the most fertile top soil, decreased land productivity and in turn declined farmer’s income. Therefore, the land management practices should be improved. This research were to find the erosion in each land unit with universal soil loss equation formula. The results of the research showed that the erosion were obviously affected by land use and slope.  Erosion in upland agriculture land use > 15 % were higher than tolerable soil loss (TSL), thus erosion in shrubs land with slope > 15 % were higher than TSL.

The results showed that application of compost made from shells of coffee fruits did not increase organic C content, total N, and available P of Oxisols during different incubation periods (i.e. after 5, 10, and 15 weeks). However, application of the compost significantly increased pH and exchangeable-K, -Ca, and –Mg of Oxisols (P>0.05). The highest pH and exchangeable-K, -Ca, and –Mg were found after application 20 ton ha-1 of compost after 5, 10, and 15 weeks of incubations.
