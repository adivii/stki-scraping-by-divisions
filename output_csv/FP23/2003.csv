of estimating C-factor for co#ee were used : (+) using similar condition with other crops (Ct), and
(,) using equivalent method based on the existing value of co#ee-C factor (Ce). The results showed
that the use of Ct gave soil loss prediction 3�,. times higher than that measured, while the use of
Ce gave +*�2+ times higher. The predicted values of soil loss using Ct were 1.1 t/ha/year and +..+
t/ha/year for Paspalum and natural weeds plots respectively. These values were still acceptable
and reasonable to the soil loss tolerance, and very low compared to the other Indonesian studies
which could be hundreds of ton/ha/y. This experiment showed that the measured co#ee C-factor

were lower than the common value (*.,) usually used in Indonesia. By introducing the e#ect of
weeds as the weeds C-subfactor (Cs) and co#ee C-factor (Cb) obtained from this experiment
measurement, the co#ee C-factor (Cc) with various weeds coverage could be estimated by the
equation Cc�Cb Cs.

The e#ects of weed management under co#ee trees on soil physical properties were investigated
during four�years experiment in Lampung, South Sumatra, Indonesia. The treatments
were as follows : co#ee without cover crop (clean-weeded plot) ; co#ee with Paspalum conjugatum
as cover crop (Paspalum plot) ; and co#ee with natural weeds which was dominated by Clibadia
surinamense (natural weeds plot). Weed management was done every two weeks by clearing all
the weeds in clean-weeded plots, and cutting the weeds around the co#ee trees with diameter + m
for the weedy plots (Paspalum plot and natural weeds plot). The results showed that a better soil
physical condition was achieved when the soil surface under the co#ee trees was covered with
Paspalum conjugatum. The average soil organic-C in the soil profile of Paspalum and natural
weeds plots were -, g/kg and ,1 g/kg respectively, which were higher than in clean-weeded plot
which had ,* g/kg of organic carbon. A smooth horizon boundary was found in Paspalum plot
due to the abundance of its roots which was also enhancing soil color more black, and the process
of wetting and drying. A strong aggregate stability was found at the Paspalum plot as indicated
by penetrometer readings as well as water stable aggregate index. Two centimeters thickness of
hardpan which was developed at Paspalum plot made the water movement from upper layer
inhibited during the dry season. The highest porosity was found at Paspalum plot (*.0.m-m�-)
followed by natural weeds plot (*.0,m-m�-) and clean-weeded plot (*.0*m-m�-). However, the
average available water content was not di#erent between Paspalum plot and natural weeds plot,
and only *.+/m-m�- higher than that of clean-weeded plot. The permeabilities varied among the
treatments, and this variance was biggest in the upper layer of Paspalum plot.

The cultivation of intercropped vegetables, red peppers, tomatoes, and long beans was introduced into the coffee fields when the coffee plants were small. No significant differences in the yields of either the coffee plants or the intercropped vegetables were noted among the treatments. Coffee shoot fresh weight, however, was slightly increased by no-tillage treatment. Soil erosion was reduced by 37% as a result of no tillage and by 64% with alley cropping. The amount of soil erosion for local farmers practice, tillage & no-alley, was more than four times that in no-tillage and alley treatment.

The results showed that the RFLP patterns of the bacterial communities were distinctly different among the microcrustaceans, although DNA fragments common to Tanycypris sp., Cypretta sp., and Heterocypris sp. were recognized. Bacterial communities associated with Tanycypris sp. showed the smallest number of fragments among the microcrustaceans studied. Rice straw and compost application exerted a negligible effect on the band patterns from Cypretta sp. and Moina sp., respectively.
