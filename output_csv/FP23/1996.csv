CH4 oxidation in the soil proved to be a biological process. The instantaneous rate of CH4 consumption was in the order of 800 μmol CH4 kg−1 day−1 (13 mg CH4 kg−1 day−1) provided the soil was treated with ca. 4.0 mmol CH4 kg−1 soil. Upon repeated supplies of a higher dose of CH4, the oxidation was accelerated to a rate of at least 198 mg CH4 kg−1 day−1. Addition of the plant-growth promoting rhizopseudomonad strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa 7NSK2 and Pseudomonas fluorescens ANP15 significantly decreased the CH4 oxidation by 20 to 30% during a 5-day incubation. However, with further incubation this suppression was no longer detectable. Growing maize plants prevented the suppression of CH4 oxidation. The numbers of methanotrophic bacteria and fungi increased significantly after the addition of CH4, but there were no significant shifts in the population of total bacteria and fluorescent pseudomonads. Drying and rewetting of soil for at least 1 day significantly reduced the activity of the indigenous methanotrophs. Upon rewetting, their activity was regained after a lag phase of about 3 days. The herbicide dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) had a strong negative effect on CH4 oxidation. The application of 5 ppm increased the time for CH4 removal; at concentrations above 25 ppm 2,4-D CH4−oxidizing activity was completely hampered. After 3 days of delay, only the treatments with below 25 ppm 2,4-D showed recovery of CH4−oxidizing activity. This finding suggests that it can be important to include a CH4−removal bioassay in ecotoxicology studies of the side effects of pesticides. Changes in the native soil pH also affected the CH4−oxidizing capacity. Permanent inhibition occurred when the soil pH was altered by 2 pH units, and partial inhibition by 1 pH unit change. A rather narrow pH range (5.9–7.7) appeared to allow CH4 oxidation. Soils pre-incubated with NH4+had a lower CH4−removal capacity. Moreover, the nitrification inhibitor 2-chloro-6-trichloromethyl pyridine (nitrapyrin) strongly inhibited CH4 oxidation. Probably methanotrophs rather than nitrifying microorganisms are mainly responsible for CH4 removal in the soil studied. It appears that the causal methanotrophs are remarkably sensitive to soil environmental disturbances.",['S1'],351,published,

The objectives of this research were to explore (1) the biomass production and total N of Azolla applicated as green manure, and (2) the growth and production of rice applicated by Azolla in some experiments locations.  The experiment consist of 5 unit with 3 locations as follow: Taman Bogo, Taman Asri, and Taman Bogo Research Station Experiment.  Five treatments in this experiment were control (without fertilizer), N (Urea), NPK (Urea + TSP + KCl), 50% N (Urea) + 50% N (Azolla), and 50% N (Azolla + TSP + KCl). The results show that application of Azolla could subsitute 50% of N fertilizer (Urea).  There were no significant differences in the rice yield of the 50% N (Urea0 + 50% (Azolla) and the NPK treatment.  The biomass production of Azilla and response of soil productivity for Azolla were determined by the soil chemical property",['S1'],1252,published,

Of the many herbicides tested and used against I. cylindrica, glyphosate has became the market leader but the potential of imazapyr is also recognized. The activity of additives to improve glyphosate and imazapyr performance is summarised and linked to a review of spray volume rates and the use of three types of application equipment: hydraulic (knapsack) sprayers, spinning discs and weed wipers. An example of the practical use of glyphosate in an estate crop is given. The role of tillage in the management of I. cylindrica is discussed but emphasis is given to pressing as a technique for promoting natural regeneration of forestry species. An integrated approach is considered to be essential for the management of I. cylindrica whereby fire prevention and methods of control are deployed in the conversion of Imperata-dominated land into sustainable, productive systems. Examples are given of integrated management in commodity plantations, rehabilitation of Imperata grasslands through reforestation, and conservation tillage to sustain soil fertility and productivity.",['S1'],1044,published,[{'type': 'http://www.loc.gov/loc.terms/relators/AUT'}]
