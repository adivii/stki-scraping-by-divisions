      "abstract": "This research aims to describe the validity of multiple representations-based\r\nblended learning programs to stimulate complex problem-solving and reduce student\r\nlearning loss. The products developed for validation are in the form of syllabi, Lesson\r\nPlans, Electronic Student Worksheets (e-Worksheet), and e-Handouts. This type of\r\nresearch includes Research and Development (R&D) using the ADDIE development\r\ndesign which consists of five steps, namely analysis, design, development,\r\nimplementation, and evaluation. This research is limited to the development stage. The\r\nanalysis phase is the problem analysis step. The design stage is designing product\r\ndevelopment. The development stage, namely product development, is carried out by\r\nproduct validation by an expert validator using a validity test sheet instrument in the\r\nform of a questionnaire. Validation scores are accumulated to obtain validity values. The\r\nresults of the investigation based on expert validation prove that the learning program\r\ndeveloped is in the category of very high validity. This shows that this learning program\r\nis worth experimenting with in teaching and learning activities to find out the practicality\r\nand effectiveness of the product in stimulating complex problem-solving and reducing\r\nlearning loss.",

The results of the data analysis showed that\r\nthe learning program developed obtained a score percentage of 91.1% with very valid\r\ncriteria. Based on the results of data analysis, it can be concluded that the learning program\r\nwith the Expression model is very valid to stimulate students' systems thinking and\r\nnumeracy skills. This is because the content validity shows that the learning program using\r\nthe Expression model can be applied in learning Physics in Senior High School Class XI in the\r\neven semester on the topic of Optics (Light Interference) to stimulate students' systems\r\nthinking and numeracy skills. Furthermore, in terms of media and design validity, the\r\nteaching materials in this learning program are very interactive or multimedia-based.\r\nTherefore, they can be innovations to attract interest and motivate students to learn.",

This study\r\naims to identify students' problem-solving and\r\ncomputational thinking abilities in solving well-structure\r\nphysics problems. The subject of this study was the eleven\r\ngrade majoring in natural science of SMAN 1 Bangunrejo.\r\nThis type of research is descriptive research. The data\r\nused to analyze the students' problem-solving and\r\ncomputational thinking abilities were obtained from the\r\nessay test. Based on the results of descriptive analysis, it\r\ncan be concluded that there is a relationship between\r\nstudents' problem-solving abilities and students'\r\ncomputational thinking abilities. In making a useful\r\ndescription, abstraction and decomposition abilities are\r\nneeded, while to determine the physics approach and\r\nspecific application of physics, generalization abiliy are\r\nneeded. In solving mathematical procedures, algorithm\r\nability are needed and to find out logical progressions,\r\ndebugging ability are needed.",
