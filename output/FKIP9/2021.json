This research design uses research and development method with Borg & Gall development model adapted into 7 development steps, namely: (1) Research and information  collection; (2) Planning; (3) Product develop Preliminary; (4) Preliminary Field Testing; (5) Main Product Revision; (6) Main Field Testing; (7) Operational Product Revision. This article is only reported until the Product develop Preliminary stage of developing the initial form of the product to be produced. Included  in this step are the preparation of supporting components, preparing guidelines and manuals, and evaluating the feasibility of supporting tools. The data collection used is a questionnaire with google form collected from high school physics teachers in Lampung. The data analysis used is qualitative descriptive  analysis. The results of this study are teachers in high school in Lampung province 75% have not used collaboration assessment instruments or communication.15% teachers already know the form of collaboration and communication assessment instruments but have not implemented them. Students have different learning abilities. Students who get low cognitive grades tend to be students who have good communication skills.90% of students tend to choose learning in practice rather than simply taking notes in class. Learning models suitable for the process of learning physics in order to improve collaboration (cooperation) and communication that is a project based learning mode l where this PJBL learning model students are required to create a project with a teamwork system in addition to improving collaboration and communication students this learning model can see soft skills possessed by students and can be developed. In this preliminary  study 100% of teachers in Lampung agreed if created and developed collaboration and communication learning assessment instruments in order to multiply or form soft skills of students",

The result of stimulating scientific processes skills through a small team test gets 88% as an average percentage with stimulated as a category. This shows that m-LKPD develops very valid and efficient ways to stimulate processes skills. Besides, m-LKPD creates the potential to be implemented in online learning and face-to-face learning, proven by students’ responses gaining 94% with very good as a category and teachers’ perceptions\r\nthat achieve 96% average percentage with very good as a category. Therefore, the developed m-LKPD can be used as multimedia to support online learning in this Covid-19 pandemic.",

This study uses a mixed method with a qualitative-quantitative explanatory design. The data collection technique used a questionnaire involving 31 respondents, 3 teachers, and 3 students as resource persons in three Islamic high schools in Lampung Province. The results of the study show that AR-assisted methods have the potential to increase teacher-student interaction by implementing a Learning Management System (LMS) that suits their needs and learning facilities. The results also show that AR provides an effective learning experience, because it displays 3D images so that it is easily accepted by students and makes students interested in learning during online learning. Therefore, the use of AR in learning has the opportunity to increase learning interactions between teachers and students.",

      "abstract": "One of the skills of the 21st-century in the era of the industrial revolution 4.0, namely higher-order thinking skills. According to TIMSS, high-level thinking skills in Indonesia are still low. Teaching materials that do not contain 21st-century skills will have an impact on the effectiveness of achieving competence in learning. This study aims to analyze the need for e-modules as teaching materials and to determine the teacher's response to the STEM integrated e-module. This research uses mixed methods. This research was conducted in several high schools in the Lampung area with 20 physics subject teachers as the research subjects. Data collection techniques using questionnaires and interviews. The object of this research is high-level thinking, Problem Based Learning model, and STEM integrated e-module analysis. The results showed that teachers need e-modules as a learning resource that is integrated with STEM to improve higher-order thinking skills. The e-module is expected to be a learning resource that can integrate text, animation, video, and audio and can explain abstract concepts in physics learning. So, in further research, an e-module based on Problem Based Learning with STEM integration can be developed to improve high-level thinking skills.",

The validity shows the content validity & construct validity, the practicality shows the ease of use & positive response from students, the effectivity shows the achievement of learning objectives namely improvement in understanding the direct current concept. This study used a 4-D learning unit development model namely (define, design, development, and disseminate stages). This study was included in a quasi-experiment study with one group pretest and posttest design. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis. Based on the results, the mean of content validity was 3.76 and construct validity was 3.75 with very valid criteria. Then, the mean of the learning unit implementation in class was 0.92 and a positive response from students in the class was 0.97 with very practical criteria. Based on paired sample t-test (tcalculation = 23.291 > ttable = 2.03011) and the N-Gain value was 0.80 (high gain) showed that the LOIS learning implementation was effective to engage students in the classroom activities.",

The results of the validation of the three validators covering aspects of construction, substance, and language, revealed that the average score of the validation results\r\nfor the construction aspects was 83% which was considered very valid. The average score of the validation results on the substance aspect is 86% with very valid criteria, and in the language aspect itreaches 85% with very valid criteria. Accordingly, this instrument of creative thinking skills is said to have been qualified with very decent and excellent quality for use in learning in schools to help teachers to assess students’ creative thinking skills",

The research used mixed methods, which consisted of qualitative data and quantitative data. This research involved 76 respondents spread across several schools in Lampung Province. Based on the preliminary study conducted, it was known that the majority of students want to use STEM-integrated PjBL-based E-Modules as a learning resource with a percentage of 61.9%, while the use of E-Modules as a learning resource used by teachers is still low at only 9.5 %. The preliminary study also saw that the E-Module that was developed later could measure problem-solving abilities with a percentage of 52.4%. Based on this, the use of E-Modules as a learning resource is needed by students, so it is necessary to conduct a needs analysis for the development of an E-Module based on STEM integrated PjBL to improve problem-solving abilities in light refraction material.",

The teachers also revealed that they were anxious that the learning resources that they will use cannot fully meet the competency standards if they are not equipped with learning technology that supports the abstract concepts learning.

      "abstract": "The accretion process occurs when neutron stars are in a binary system. The hypothesis says that accretion reduces the magnetic field in a neutron star. The correlation between accretion and decrease in the magnetic field is indicated by the magnitude of the magnetic field dynamics and the mass accretion rate. The purpose of this research is to formulate the mass rate of accretion in rapidly rotating neutron stars. The accretion disc is assumed to be at the equator. The method used is theoretical-mathematical analysis. The quantities to be summarized are the Killing vector, 4-vector velocity, the angular velocity, and the Lorentz gamma factor derived from the metric. The metric used is a rapidly rotating neutron star. The rate of mass accretion is calculated from these quantities and the equation for mass sustainability. The equation of mass accretion rate is derived from these variables and the mass conservation equation. The equation of mass accretion rate is affected by the radial velocity of accretion flows and distance between matter and center of a neutron star. The result obtained is covariant with the equation of mass accretion rate for Kerr black holes. The results obtained can provide a dynamic equation for the magnetic field to produce an equation for the decrease in the magnetic field in a rapidly rotating neutron star.",

Design Stage made with sheet validation by the practitioner using a Likert scale Validator product design consisting of ten professional physics teachers with qualifications Master of Physical Education. The research results obtained that it is needed the development of STEM-\r\nBased Multimedia Design for Stimulating HOTS on Water and Wind Energy topic. The multimedia design that has the potential to stimulate HOTS on the water and wind energy\r\nmateres consists of videos and animation of water and wind energy power plants that contain all components of STEM. Because the design was obtained valid to used, so, further research to develop STEM-based multimedia for stimulating HOTS on water and wind energy materials is needed.",
