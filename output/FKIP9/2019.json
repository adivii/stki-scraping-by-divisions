The methodology in this research is based on ADDIE \r\nmodel research and development (R&D) design which consist of analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The data resource was the students and teachers of XII grade of senior high schools in Lampung Province. The instrument used were questionnaire and test instrument. Data analysis technique was conducted\r\ndescriptively with interval using n-gain, independent t-test, and paired t-test. The research showed that interactive e-book on electromagnetic radiation was effective for self-study and to increase critical thinking skill of the students significantly at a confidence level of 95%,  with Ngaining experimental group <g> = 0.76 which was higher than in control group <g> = 0.55. Therefore, it can be concluded that the product which was developed namely interactive e-book\r\non electromagnetic radiation is effective for self-study and to increase students' critical thinking skill.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. This research aims to develop interactive e-book on electromagnetic radiation topic, which can be used for self-study, and to increase students critical thinking skill. The methodology in this research is based on ADDIE model research and development (R&D) design which consist of analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The data resource was\r\nthe students and teachers of XII grade of senior high schools in Lampung Province. The instrument used were questionnaire and test instrument. Data analysis technique was conducted descriptively with interval using n-gain, independent t-test, and paired t-test. The research showed that interactive e-book on electromagnetic radiation was effective for self-study and to increase critical thinking skill of the students significantly at a confidence level of 95%,  with Ngaining experimental group <g> = 0.76 which was higher than in control group <g> = 0.55. Therefore, it can be concluded that the product which was developed namely interactive e-book on electromagnetic radiation is effective for self-study and to increase students' critical thinking skill.",

This research uses R & D research procedures. In the development stage, a validity test was conducted by 2 experts namely design experts and material experts, then continued with the practicality and effectiveness test of student worksheets conducted by 24 students of class XI IPA SMA. The results of the material expert validation received a value of 83.5% in the \"very feasible\" category. Then the design expert validation results got a value of 95% with the category \"very feasible\". Based on the results of the physics worksheet based on analogy of content from the aspects of design and material has valid criteria and is suitable for use. Then the practicality of the analogy-based physics student worksheets content received a positive response of 89%. And the effectiveness of physics student worksheets based on analogy of effective content improves students' critical thinking skills based on the results of the experimental class that obtained a Gain of 0.6 higher than the control class with a Gain of 0.2.",

This study method was conducted by quasi experimental. Data gained from 29 Senior High School Students. Data was collected by questionnaire, observation sheets and tested students’ critical thinking skills. Data was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative analysis used was to determine the practicality of the interactive electronic books and quantitative analysis used was to see the effectiveness of interactive electronic books. This study\r\nresult is to show that the interactive electronic books can be used practically for students’ selfstudy. Practicality as a user response shows that inter-active\r\nelectronic books are very effective, highly interactive,\r\nefficient, usable, and can be used for students’ self-study. The implementation of the use of interactive electronic books in overall learning worked well. This is\r\nseen from the liveliness and ease of students in using interactive electronic books. The results of effectiveness test indicate that the application of interactive electronic book in learning can improve\r\nstudents' critical thinking ability. The N-gain results indicate that the magnitude of differences after and before the learning is in moderate category and result of\r\neffect test is in moderate category. The average indicator of critical thinking is getting increased after\r\nbeing conducted the learning by using interactive electronic books.",

The research method used a development research model developed by the model of Borg & Gall. In this study, 7 steps were used consisting of research and information gathering, planning, initial product development, limited trials, initial product revisions, field trials, and final product revisions. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling technique, namely the high school students of class X in Tanggamus. The instruments used are validation instruments, practicality tests, and critical and creative thinking skills, and test instruments for critical and creative thinking skills. Test instrument analysis techniques use validity and reliability analysis, different levels of difficulty and power. The validation results of three expert lecturers and three expert practitioners stated that the assessment results of the development were feasible to be used in the high category (72%) for aspects of language, construction, and content. Assessment instruments resulting from practical development are used in physics learning with an average score in the very high category (83.3%). Assessment instruments are used in learning as assessment for learning, students who have the ability to think critically and creatively with good categories reach 56.5% and 57.4%. Thus, assessment instruments for critical and creative thinking skills that have been developed effectively train students to have good critical and creative thinking skills, so that assessment instruments can be used as an assessment for learning for students.",

The research method used a development research model developed by the model of Borg & Gall. In this study, 7 steps were used consisting of research and information gathering, planning, initial product development, limited trials, initial product revisions, field trials, and final product revisions. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling technique, namely the high school students of class X in Tanggamus. The instruments used are validation instruments, practicality tests, and critical and creative thinking skills, and test instruments for critical and creative thinking skills. Test instrument analysis techniques use validity and reliability analysis, different levels of difficulty and power. The validation results of three expert lecturers and three expert practitioners stated that the assessment results of the development were feasible to be used in the high category (72%) for aspects of language, construction, and content. Assessment instruments resulting from practical development are used in physics learning with an average score in the very high category (83.3%). Assessment instruments are used in learning as assessment for learning, students who have the ability to think critically and creatively with good categories reach 56.5% and 57.4%. Thus, assessment instruments for critical and creative thinking skills that have been developed effectively train students to have good critical and creative thinking skills, so that assessment instruments can be used as an assessment for learning for students.",

This is effective if it is supported by teaching materials in the form of physics comics. Furthermore, the aim of this research development is to produce STEM-based Physics Comics products that are valid, interesting, easy, and useful, and effective for stimulating concept mastery in junior high school students. It has been done validity test which are consists of design expert test and material expert test, and the product is valid as to be used. The attractiveness, convenience, and benefit\r\ntest is conducted by students and the results of attractiveness were obtained by 3.38, convenience with a score of 3.38 and benefit test were obtained 3.31. This research was conducted using one group pre post design. The results of the paired sample t test. Sig value. (2-Tailed) is less than 0.05 which is 0,000, so it can be explained related to the significant use of STEM, on the ability to master students’ concepts. Based on the\r\nvalue of N-gain, the average N-gain of concept mastery ability is 0.43 with the medium category.",

The research involved 67Senior High School 5 students Bandar Lampung in Lampung Province, Indonesia. The research design used was the-Equivalent Control Group Pretest and Posttest Design. The experimental class used STEM Learning Approach, and the control class used a scientific approach. The data was collected using pretest and posttest score of scientific literacy inventory. The Effectiveness analysis was done using the Normalized Gain (N–Gain) and Effect Size. Based on the research, the average score of the scientific literacy skill with N-gain of experimental classes was 0.55 and control class was 0.49, both classes were in medium category achievement. The result of effect size test showed that STEM learning approach has an effect size in the medium category of 0.24. Furthermore, based on an analysis of T-test results, there was a difference between the N-gain average score of the students' scientific literacy skill between experimental class and control class. The students who learned with STEM learning approach has a significantly higher degree of scientific literacy skill than those who learned with the scientific approach. So the conclusion in this research is that the students taught using the STEM approach are in the \"conceptual\" category which is better in explaining the concept, able to describe the relationship between these concepts, and able to analyze alternative solutions and procedural skills and understanding of the process of discovering science and technology.",

The method used was the survey with questionnaires as\r\nthe data collecting instruments. The respondents were 71 Physics\r\nteachers in Lampung. The results of data analysis showed that\r\n47.9% of teachers knew assessment for learning; 53.5 % of\r\nteachers knew assessment as learning. The assessment, in the prelearning, was frequently carried out by 5.6% of teachers; during\r\nthe learning, carried out by 16.9% of teachers; and in postlearning, carried out by 23.9% of teachers. The data showed that\r\nmost of the teachers conducted assessments in post-learning more\r\nthan during and in pre-learning. The results of the data analysis\r\nidentified that the teachers experienced several obstacles, namely,\r\nlack of time, unavailability of assessment instruments, lack of\r\ntraining or the teachers were not used to conducting the\r\nassessment, too many students to assess, and the differences of\r\nthe students' capabilities and characteristics. The data showed\r\nthat the assessment for and as learning carried out in the\r\nlearning process had not been fully implemented. Therefore, a\r\nfollow-up was needed to overcome these obstacles so that the\r\nassessment in the learning process can be completed.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to determine the effect of the application of the Argument-Driven Inquiry (ADI) learning model on students' critical thinking abilities and to determine the differences in critical thinking skills between female and male students in the class using the learning model Argument-Driven Inquiry (ADI). The subjects of this study were students of class VIII.1 and VIII.5 JHS 13 Bandarlampung, consisting of 30 students of class VIII.1 and 30 students of class VIII.5. The sample was taken using a purposive technique by looking at the class with the same number of female and male students. The research design used was quasi-experimental design with Pretest-posttest Control Group Design and data collection techniques of critical thinking skills using pretest-posttest, which refers to the five criteria of critical thinking according to Ennis. The results showed that (1) there is an effect of applying the Argument-Driven Inquiry learning model on female students' critical thinking skills as indicated by the sig value. equal to 0,0001 (2) there is an effect of the application of the Argument-Driven Inquiry learning model on male students' critical thinking skills as indicated by the sig value. for 0,000 (3) there is no difference in critical thinking skills between female and male students using the ADI model indicated by the sig value and amounting to 0.725. That is, the application of the Argument-Driven Inquiry model affects the critical thinking skills of both female and male students, but there is no difference in critical thinking skills between female and male students. This means, the implementation of Argument-Driven Inquiry model effective on students’ critical thinking skill, but there is no difference in critical thinking skills between female and male students.",

This research is a development research which used ADDIE method consisting of 5 stages, namely: (1) analysis,\r\n(2) design, (3) development, (4) implementation, and (5) evaluation. Pre-research data analysis has been collected from 130 students and 4 physics teachers of 3 Senior High Schools in Bandar Lampungby using questionnaire and has been analyzed descriptive-quantitatively. At the design stage, storyboard making was conducted based on the needs of teachers and students in the school as well as the opinion of four experts in physics education. Electronic books on quantum phenomena are deloped with a scientific approach based on indicators of higher-order thinking skills. At the development stage, the realization of electronic book design was carried out and it was then followed by the making of the higher-order thinking skills instrument. The implementation of the electronic was conducted on the students in a class of a Senior High\r\nSchool in Bandar Lampung. The result of the development of the electronic book on quantum phenomena is assessed based on 3 aspects: (1) validity, (2) practicality, and (3) effectiveness. Validity and the practicality of data were obtained by using the validity sheet and questionnaire, effectiveness data were obtained by using higher-order thinking test instrument. Based on the result of data analysis, the product of electronic book on quantum phenomena which is valid, practical, and effective to be used to enhance the higher-order thinking skills of the students.",

This study consists of four procedural steps: Problem identification, data sampling, product design, and design\r\nvalidation. The result of need assessment was obtained from 71 Senior High School students and Physics Teachers from several schools in Bandar Lampung. The result of the questionnaires as a data sampling technique was analyzed in quantitative and descriptive methods. The result shows that a physics textbook as a learning source material hasn’t been optimally functioned to grow self-confidence to overcome National Examination. On the other hand, the teacher requires Physics source material, which\r\nfacilitates the learning process with the scientific approach, can improve critical thinking skills, and possible to be conducted in self-directed learning. The validation test results indicate that the type of source material that can accommodate 12th-grade students and physics teachers is an interactive electronic book\r\nthat contains feedback. Stimulate activities in understanding concepts through images, animation. And finally complete with examples of problems and competency tests to improve students'conceptual understanding.",

Before learning process, the students given pretest and scale of self eficacy. The critical  thinking of  the student's skill was obtained through tests using HOTS assessment. Analysis of data (pretest-posttest) was the description of the results of the average effect size of sample then categorized based on Cohen’s interpretation. Analysis of students’ self efficacy was using three indicators in instruments are\r\nmagnitude, strength, generality. The results showed that the interactive multimedia developed is effective to improving  students’ critical thinking in learning science. Beside, learning process with interactive multimedia encourage students’ self perception.",

      "abstract": "Critical thinking skills are important in the context of 21st-century learning, where students are able\r\nto express reasons that support the assumptions or conclusions they obtain. A preliminary study at 25 Bandar\r\nLampung Middle Schools found that science learning had not been maximized in training critical thinking\r\nskills. This study aims to determine the effect of applying the Argument-Driven Inquiry (ADI) learning model\r\non students’ critical thinking skills based on differences in academic abilities, gender, and personality type.\r\nThis study used Nonequivalent (Pretest and Posttest) Control Group Design and One-Group Pretest-Posttest\r\nDesign. The data of pretest and posttest essay questions results were analyzed using nonparametric statistical\r\ntests. The results showed that there was an effect of ADI learning on critical thinking skills in high and low\r\nacademic students. Moreover, this model provided a greater influence on students’ high academic abilities.\r\nThe ADI model could also accommodate all male and female students with various types of personality\r\ntypes because the gender and personality type aspects do not show significant differences in students’ critical\r\nthinking abilities, both between male and female students and students with different personality types.\r\nOverall, the ADI model is effective in improving students’ critical thinking skills.",

Many studies showed that the ability of\r\na teacher in technology-integrated pedagogy is influenced by their attitude towards technology. The aim of this\r\nstudy was to use exploratory factor analysis in examining the structural factors, the preference level and the\r\ninterrelationship among components of attitude towards technology. Data was collected from 150 pre-service\r\nscience teachers in Lampung University by using traditional survey method. Additionally, variance, mean values\r\ncomparison, and Cronbach Alpha coefficients were analyzed in explaining the contributions of items and factors\r\nto the overall attitude towards technology. Pearson correlation analysis was also conducted to find out the\r\nrelationship among components. The results confirmed the validity of instrument with loading factors ranging\r\nfrom 0.427–0.882. In addition, the total Cronbach Alpha coefficient was 0.810 which informed a high internal\r\nconsistency of instrument with five components of technological attitude account for 77.82% of variance.\r\nSpecifically, the perceived consequence of technology is identified as a dominant attitudinal preference of preservice science teachers in Indonesia, followed by career aspirations and gender difference. Pearson productmoment analysis revealed a significant correlation among components of attitude towards technology.",

      "abstract": "Representation is a form that can describe a certain material concept.  In physics learning, students are required to be able to present a concept of physical matter into various possible forms of representation. The ability of students to use multiple representation indicates that the students have fully understood the concept of physics (no misconception occur). Facts that occur in the field is still limited form of representation used by teachers when teaching physics, so it is still possible to students misconception. This study aims to explore Multiple representation preference used in the process of physical learning to develop SMI in measuring students science conception. Method used is qualitative method through semi-structured interviews to teacher and students. It uses simple random sampling technique. Exploration results based on depthly structured interviews to teacher and students have shown that there are several aspects of sources and causes students' misconception. The results of analysis also obtained a number of qualitative information which supports the development and validation of the instrument to measure the degree of students science conception. This instrument can be used to identify misconception and level awareness of students conception.",

The purpose of this research is to determine the model and utilization of the information communication technology (ICT) that effectively improve the science process skill (SPS). The method used is quasi-experiment. The sample was selected using purposive sampling technique as many as 12 classes of junior high schools in Lampung Province with average initial ability were equivalent. The material that is learned is about the measurement. Data were collected using SPS observation sheet and analysed using two-way ANOVA. The first factor is ICT media model those are the tutorial and the simulation media model of measuring instrument. The second factor is the utilization model of ICT media those are the substitute-experimental, the substitute-demonstration, the complement-experimental, the complement-demonstration, the supplement-experimental, and the supplement-demonstration. The result of the research shows that there is no difference of SPS caused by the difference of ICT media model, there is a difference of SPS caused by the different model of ICT utilization. There is an interaction between media utilization model and ICT media model in terms of SPS. The highest SPS was obtained from the learning using the tutorial media model that was learned as a supplement using the experimental method.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. The purpose of this research is to determine the model and utilization of the information communication technology (ICT) that effectively improve the science process skill (SPS). The method used is quasi-experiment. The sample was selected using purposive sampling technique as many as 12 classes of junior high schools in Lampung Province with average initial\r\nability were equivalent. The material that is learned is about the measurement. Data were collected using SPS observation sheet and analysed using two-way ANOVA. The first factor is ICT media model those are the tutorial and the simulation media model of measuring instrument.\r\nThe second factor is the utilization model of ICT media those are the substitute-experimental, the substitute-demonstration, the complement-experimental, the complement-demonstration, the supplement-experimental, and the supplement-demonstration. The result of the research shows that there is no difference of SPS caused by the difference of ICT media model, there is a\r\ndifference of SPS caused by the different model of ICT utilization. There is an interaction between media utilization model and ICT media model in terms of SPS. The highest SPS was obtained from the learning using the tutorial media model that was learned as a supplement using the experimental method.",

      "abstract": "A STEM learning model is believed to be able to improve students’ performance in learning physics significantly including Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS).These skills covered the capability to analyze, evaluate, and create which can be boosted by implementing a right learning model, material, and assessment. This study aims to develop and evaluate a combined HOTS-based assessment\/STEM learning model to enhance students’ thinking skills. A proposed model was designed by follow the seven steps of Borg & Gall research and development.\r\nThere are 24 24 eleventh graders of SMAN 1 Kotabumi at North Lampung and 30 tenth graders of SMA YP Unila at Bandar Lampung involved in limited and field trial, respectively. The impact of this model was evaluated by identifying the normalized average gain of pretest posttest and significance test compared to a conventional STEM model. The results showed that t-value of experimental, control, and comparison of these two classes are 23.29, 13.58, and 4.63 (p<0.001), \r\n respectively which confirm a better improvements of thinking skills performed by proposed model.",

      "abstract": "The objectieves of this research are to describe the respondents' perceptions toward the national examination\r\nand to explore the barriers encountered by the respondents in implementing national examination. To meet\r\nthe objectives of the study, descriptive qualitative is chosen as a research method. A descriptive design\r\nnamely survey is chosen for this study because it collects the details of current attitude, knowledge and\r\nexperience of respondents on the implementation of the national examination and national-standardized\r\nschool examination. The research was conducted in Indonesia, comprising three regions, namely Eastern,\r\nCentral, and Western part of Indonesia. Six provinces were selected which proportionally represent the\r\nregions of East, Central and West Indonesia. The data gathered from questionnaire were analyzed by using\r\ndescriptive analysis. The results show that the implementation of the UN and USBN, which has been\r\nongoing, is in accordance with the SOP that has been established by the BSNP. Most principals and teachers\r\nfelt that they were not involved in the preparation of the SOP, but the provincial education office made the\r\ntranslation of the SOP in the form of USBN technical instructions and shared to the education unit. All\r\nteachers get sensitized about USBN from district\/city education schools and services. Implementation of\r\nNational Exams and USBN can be used to improve performance. But, the current USBN at elementary\r\nschool is only to improve student achievement in cognitive aspects only. Regarding to its limitation of study,\r\nfurther study would be suggested to explore other aspects of national examination such as quality control of\r\nnational examination question and wash-back of the examination",

The\r\nstudy aims to determine the effectiveness of integrated IPA learning based on guided inquiry to improve the competence of learners. This research uses quasi experiment method with pretest-posttest group control design. The subjects of the study were students of eight grades at SMP Negeri 24 Padang. Data were collected using\r\nobservation sheets, learning outcome test, skill assessment sheets, and attitude questionnaires. The result of the research indicates that the learning of integrated science based on guided inquiry is effectively to improve the student’s competence, based on: (1) Mastery learning of has been achieved by most (87.5%) students on knowledge competence, 96.9% on skills and 100% on attitude competence. (2) The improvement of student’s competency on experiment class including high category on knowledge domain, (3) Average competence of experiment class is higher than control class. (4) The effect of the implementation of integrated science based on guided inquiry to the student’s competence including large categories. (5) Student response to the implementation of learning is very good category.",

A total of 62 pre-service physics teachers were \r\nenrolled in an introductory physics course. Line-supported blended learning was \r\nimplemented in an experiment group whereas learning management system (LMS)-\r\nbased blended learning was as the control group. Data were collected through test, \r\nquestionnaire, and interview. The test and questionnaire consisted of 20 multiple \r\nchoice questions and five open-ended questions, respectively. Meanwhile, the \r\ninterview was a semi-structured interview performed through a focus group \r\ninterview. The analysis results have given the information that there is no \r\nsignificant difference in the overall improvement of learning outcomes between the \r\ntwo groups. However, students in experiment group have significantly higher \r\nimprovement of analy¬sis skills than their counterparts in control group.",

      "abstract": "Lately the industrial revolution era 4.0 has become a discourse in various fields. One of them is education. The education sector is the front guard of the country. In the field of education, there needs to be a plan that is structured in the making of teaching materials because teaching materials are the main learning for students. This study aims to describe and analyze teachers and students on the national curriculum teaching materials based on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The study was involving grade XI 233 senior high school students and 3 physics teachers. The method is used in this study with sequential explanatory. The research instrument used questionnaires, interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGD). The results showed that to support STEM learning in national curriculum needed teaching materials to include lesson plans, books, animation, stimulation, and video. Components of book teaching materials include core competencies, basic competencies, indicators, objectives, concept maps, pictures, videos, animations, material that is explained in detail in each chapter, detailed discussion, internet links, summaries, and questions. The video components include core competencies, basic competencies, goals, indicators, abducting, using everyday language, complete materials and easy to understand. The material needed to develop teaching materials in physics between stationary waves, dynamic and static electricity, temperature and heat and Newton law. All teaching materials are expected to be based on e-learning or mobile learning. In the national curriculum, the teacher has not started STEM-based teaching materials. So in the future, there needs to be the development of STEM-based teaching materials to support the national curriculum that is designed to the maximum.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Lately the industrial revolution era 4.0 has become a discourse in various fields. One of them is education. The education sector is the front guard of the country. In the field of education, there needs to be a plan that is structured in the making of teaching materials because teaching materials are the main learning for students. This study aims to describe and analyze teachers and students on the national curriculum teaching materials based on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The study was involving grade XI 233 senior high school students\r\nand 3 physics teachers. The method is used in this study with sequential explanatory. The research instrument used questionnaires, interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGD). The results showed that to support STEM learning innational curriculum needed teaching materials to include lesson plans, books, animation, stimulation,\r\nand video. Components of book teaching materials include core competencies, basic competencies, indicators, objectives, concept maps, pictures, videos, animations, material that is explained in detail in each chapter, detailed discussion, internet links, summaries, and questions. The video components include core competencies, basic competencies, goals, indicators, abducting, using everyday language, complete materials and easy to understand. The material needed to develop teaching materials in physics between stationary waves, dynamic and static electricity, temperature and heat and Newton law. All teaching materials are expected to be based on e-learning or mobile learning. In the national curriculum, the teacher has not started STEM-based teaching materials. So in the future, there needs to be the development of STEM-based teaching materials to support the national curriculum that is designed to the maximum.",

      "abstract": "Dental panoramic radiographs heavily depend on the performance of the segmentation\r\nmethod due to the presence of unevenly illumination and low contrast of the images.\r\nConditional Spatial Fuzzy C-mean (csFCM) Clustering have been proposed to achieve through\r\nthe incorporation of the component and added in the FCM to cluster grouping. This algorithm\r\ndirects with consideration conditioning variables that consider membership value. However,\r\ncsFCM does not consider Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set to take final membership and final nonmembership value into account, the effect does not wipe off the deviation by illumination and\r\nlow contrast of the images completely for improvement to skip some scope. In this current\r\npaper, we introduced a new image segmentation method namely Conditional Spatial in\r\nIntuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means Clustering for Segmentation of Teeth in Dental Panoramic\r\nRadiographs. Our proposed method adds hesitation function aiming to settle the indication of\r\nthe knowledge lack that belongs to the final membership function to get a better segmentation\r\nresult. The experiment result shows this method achieves better segmentation performance with\r\nmisclassification error (ME) and relative foreground area error (RAE) values are 4.77 and 4.27\r\nrespectively.",
