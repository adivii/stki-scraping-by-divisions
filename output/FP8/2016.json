      "abstract": "A Study was conducted to investigate the effect of thidiazuron (TDZ)and benzyladenine (BA) on shoot and embryogenic nodule formation in banana tissue culture. The study consisted of two experiments. The first experiment was conducted to study response of banana cv Kepok Kuning to thidiazuron (TDZ) and benzyladenine (BA) in vtro. Shoot tips were used as explants and cultured on MS medium containing MS salts, 100 mg\/l myo-inositol, 0.1 mg\/l thiamine-HCl, 0.5 mg\/l pyridoxine-HCl, 0.5 mg\/l nicotinic acid, 2 mg\/l glycine, 30 g\/l sucrose, combination of TDZ (0.005, 0.001, 0.05, and 0.1 mg\/l) and BA (0 and 2 mg\/l)as treatments. The medium was solidified with 8 g\/l agar. Some cultures formed embryogenic nodules, and these structures were then cultured on MS medium supplemented with 0.1 mg\/l TDZ or 0.1 mg\/l TDZ + 2 mg\/l BA as treatments. The second experiment aimed to investigate response of banana (cv. Raja Bulu) embryogenic nodules to TDZ and BA as previously described in the first experiment. The medium was as previously described for the first experiment. Results of the first experiment revealed that BA did not significantly affected shoot and shoot bud. The highest number of shoots was attained at 0.05 mgl TDZ (2.6 shoots per explant0. Treantment 0.1 mg\/l TDZ and 0.1 mg\/l TDZ + 2 mg\/l BA resulted in formation of embryogenic nodules. Results of the second experiment showed that increased in TDZ concentrations did not significantly affect embryogenic nodule proliferation. In contrast, addition of 2 mg\/l BA significantly decreased number of embryogenic nodules, from 12.5 to 6.2 embryogenic nodules per explant. For propagation purpose, cv. Kepok Kuning required 0.005 mg\/l TDZ for shoot and shoot bud multiplication and 0.1 mgl TDZ for embryogenic nodule proliferation and cv. Raja Bulu required 0.005 mg\/l TDZ for embryogenic nodule proliferation.\r\nKey Words: Benzyladenine, Kepok Kuning, Raja Bulu, shoot tips, thidiazuron.",

      "abstract": "The cultivation of sweet corn (Zea mays L. spp. saccharata {Sturt.} Bailey) on acidic red-yellow podsolic (RYP) soil in Lampung, Indonesia was hampered by the low fertility and pH of the soil.  Soil amendment with Ca and Mg would improve growth and development of the sweet corn cultivars, as well as differentiating environments in selecting for adaptive cultivars. Aglime, dolomite, Portland cement, and a mixture of 3 aglime: 2 dolomite (w\/w) were applied on LASS YellowRound (Y-R), LASS Yellow-wrinkle (Y-w), Bicolor and LAS Yellow-wrinkle (Y-w).  The results indicated that the kinds of Ca and the doses apllication were capable to differentiate the sweet corn cultivars.  Aglime 400 kg ha-1 was the best treatment to modify plant environment as selection factor followed by cement 400, dolomite 200 and aglime-dolomite mixture 400 kg ha-1. They improved the growth of the cultivars as well. The characters of interest of the cultivar had complied with those of commercial standard, except for plant height, ear diameter, and kernel-rows ear-1. However, since the genetic variation and broadsense heritability values for those characters were essentially zero, the subsequent improvement would require genes from the outside populations. \r\n \r\nKeywords: calcium; magnesium; sweet corn; Zea mays spp. saccharata",
