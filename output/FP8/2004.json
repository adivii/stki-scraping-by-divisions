      "abstract": "The cultivation of potato in the lowlands is expected to be an alternative to its cultivation in the uplands. It is expected that through its cultivation in the lowlands, the examined potato cultivars will be able to flower and produce minitubers. Its success in flowering, bearing fruit, and producing botanical seed will automatically sustain cultivar testers and further produce genuine Indonesian potato cultivars.The mini-tuber products are useful as industrial raw materials of nyamikan (sweet snack or candy) potato as well as tuber seeds tobe planted in the highlands.Therefore, this study aims at examining  the ability of potatoes to flower and produce mini bulbs. This research was conducted in Bandar Lampung lowland, within a \r\n“split-split plot design with imbedded quasi randomized incomplete block design” through four replications. The main plot is the SP36 and KCl fertilizer treatment. The sub-comparment is Gandasil  foliar fertilizer and Grow More. Whereas the sub-comparment branch is five potato cultivars: Red Russet, Red Australia, Kentucky, Yellow Tess, and Dark Tess. The insertion of uncomplete quasi-group design is the grafting treatment with rampai and eggplant. The research reveals that the five potato cultivars may possibly bear flowers in the lowlands. However, it is only Red Russet, Yellow Tess and Dark Tess which potentially produce minitubers. Unfortunately, the produced flowers falled after 48 hours. The increasing treatment of SP36, KCl, Gandasil, and Grow More fertilizers has no effect on flower initiation. \r\nInstead, it has direct effect at the first bloom of flowers. Because of serious drought, it is not all grafting treatment with rampai be successful. \r\n \r\nKey Words: Breedingplants, SolanumtuberosumL., flowerinitiation, minibulbs",
