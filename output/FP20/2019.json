      "abstract": "Pasaran Island waters is the location of green mussel cultivation (Perna viridis), where the waters has the potential to experience heavy metal pollution including Cadmium (Cd). Green mussels are filter feeders and have a slow movement, thus they have the potential to experience heavy metal bioconcentration on their bodies. The aim of this study was to determine the bioconcentration of heavy metal cadmium (Cd) in green mussels (Perna viridis) which were cultivated in the waters of Pasaran Island. Samples were collected in February 2018 in green mussel cultivating cages of Pasaran Island water with 3 and 6 cm mussel size. Sampling was taken at three stations with three replications each. The Cd content was analyzed using AAS method. The results showed that the water content of Cd at the observation location ranged from 0.022 to 0.024 mg\/l. The content of Cd of mussel meat is 0.030 to 0.033 mg\/kg, the value is below the threshold based on Indonesian National Standard (SNI). The BFC value of 3 cm mussel is 1.33 mg\/kg, while the 6 cm mussel is 1.47 mg\/kg which indicates that the green mussels on Pasaran Island are accumulatively low on Cd.",

      "abstract": "Aquaponics is a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics system. This system is expected to be able to overcome the problems of waste from aquaculture by utilizing Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) for vegetables. There are several obstacles found in aquaponics systems such as high suspended organic matter produced from the feed residue and fish metabolism. The addition of natural filters, namely freshwater mussels (Pilsbryoconcha exilis) is expected to solve these problems. This research was conducted for 40 days. The design used in this study was Factorial Completely Randomized Design with two main factors namely mussels density as factor-A and time of observation as factor-B. The treatments were P1 (0 mussels density), P2 (15 mussels density), and P3 (30 mussels density) for factor-A while time of observation were factor-B (D-0, D-10, D-20, D-30 and D-40). Each treatment was conducted in three repetition. The results showed that the time observation gave significantly different on water condition changes (P <0.05), which will increase TSS, turbidity and chlorophyll value along with the increasing of time. P exilis in aquaponics was effective in reducing turbidity and chlorophyll concentration (P <0.05). Therefore, aquaponics system with the highest mussels density (P3) with has lower turbidity and chlorophyll value than the one with 0 mussels density (P1)",
