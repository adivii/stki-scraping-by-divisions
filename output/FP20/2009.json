      "abstract": "This research was held on October-November 2008 to study some heavy metals, i.e. Pb, Hg, Cu,and Cd, which contained in some fishes at Bandar Lampung coastal area.  The method of this study was measuring concentration of Pb, Hg, Cu, and Cd, by spectrophotometric. Fish samples\r\nwere taken from Sukaraja, Karang Maritim, Gudang Agen, Puri Gading, and Lempasing.  Most of the fish tested contained heavy metals Cd, Cu, and Pb in various concentrations. Mercury (Hg) was detected only in fish samples from the Sukaraja Coast. Overall, the content of heavy metals in fish samples were still below from the maximum limit of heavy metal contamination in food for fish commodities, according to SNI 01-2729.1-2006 and SK Dirjen POM No.03725\/B\/SK\/VII\/89. Although the fish samples contain few heavy metals, but it must be\r\nconsidered by stakeholders because of the heavy metal pollution is one of serious problems. Then the government must prevent, or at least, reduce the rate of those pollutions.",
