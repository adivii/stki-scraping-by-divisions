The objective of this study\r\nwas to evaluate the resistance to cowpea mild motlle virus (CPMMV) of 19 F1 population of soybean showing good agronomic characters. The F1 population were generated by complete diallel crosses involving  a  resistant  parent  (Mlg  2521),  a  moderately  resistant  parent  (B  3570),  and  three susceptible parents (Orba, Wilis, and GKUL-1).\tThe experiment was arranged in a completely randomized block design consisted of two replications.  The results indicated that F1  population B3570 x Mlg 2521 was resistant to CPMMV and superior in seed weight per plant, number of branches, plant height, total number of pods, total number of seeds, and the number of healthy seeds. F1  population Wilis x B 3570 and B 3570 x Wilis were moderately resistant and less superior in agronomic characters than B 3570 x Mlg 2521.\r\nKey words: CPMMV, diallel, Glycine max,viral resistance",

      "abstract": "One of the limitations to conducting maize Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using explants of immature zygotic embryos routinely is the availability of the explants. To produce immature embryos routinely and continuously requires a well-equipped greenhouse and laborious artificial pollination. To overcome this limitation, an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system using explants of type II embryogenic calli was developed. Once the type II embryogenic calli are produced, they can be subcultured and\/or proliferated conveniently. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate a stable Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of maize using explants of type II embryonic calli and to evaluate the efficiency of the protocol in order to develop herbicide-resistant maize. The type II embryogenic calli were inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 carrying binary vector pTF102, and then were subsequently cultured on the following media: co-cultivation medium for 1 day, delay medium for 7 days, selection medium for 4 × 14 days, regeneration medium, and finally on germination medium. The T-DNA of the vector carried two cassettes (Ubi promoter-EPSPs ORF-nos and 35S promoter–bar ORF-nos). The EPSPs conferred resistance to glyphosate and bar conferred resistance to phosphinothricin. The confirmation of stable transformation and the efficiency of transformation was based on the resistance to phosphinothricin indicated by the growth of putative transgenic calli on selection medium amended with 4 mg l−1 phosphinothricin, northern blot analysis of bar gene, and leaf painting assay for detection of bar gene-based herbicide resistance. Northern blot analysis and leaf painting assay confirmed the expression of bar transgenes in the R1 generation. The average transformation efficiency was 0.60%. Based on northern blot analysis and leaf painting assay, line 31 was selected as an elite line of maize resistant to herbicide.\r\n\r\nKeywords\r\n\r\nAgrobacteriumGenetic transformationType II embryogenic calliZea mays L.",

      "abstract": "Soybean and corn are two food commodities that will always be developed in the future. Seed\r\nviability test to support seeds supply will always be done. In the future, seedmen in Indonesia\r\nhave to understand that there is a quick test named tetrazolium than can be used to test seed\r\nviability as well as germination test. The objective of this experiment was to compare the results\r\nof tetrazolium test and germination test on soybean and corn seeds. This experiment was\r\nconducted in a complete design with four replicates. Tetrazolium test and germination test\r\nmethods were used as two treatments in this experiment. Four variables observed were a)\r\ngerminable seeds that could form normal seedling (GSCNS) in TZ test equivalent to normal\r\nseedlings (NS) in germination test, b) germinable seeds that could form abnormal seedling\r\n(GSCANS) in TZ test equivalent to abnormal seedlings (ANS) in germination test, c) non\r\ngerminable seeds (NGS) in TZ test equivalent to dead seeds (DS)in germination test, and d) total\r\nviability (TV). The comparation of average value of TZ test and germination test used statistic\r\nvalue of t-student in the significant level of 5%. Results showed that the computed t-values < the\r\ntabular t-value. It was a mean that there was no significant different between TZ test results and\r\ngermination test results either on soybean and on corn seeds respectively.\r\nKeywords: corn, germination, seed, soybean, TZ test.",
