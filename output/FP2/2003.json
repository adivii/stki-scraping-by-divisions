      "abstract": "In some country, Arachis pintoi has been cultivated as legume cover crops in plantation, pasture land, and park. This research is aimed to study: (1) effect of multi-cutting per bag on growth of stem and sprout cutting of A. pintoi, (2) covering velocity of A. pintoi compared to other LCC, and (3) performance of A. pintoi cultivated under vanilla plantation. The results showed that the growth of sprout cutting was better than those of stem cutting, and cutting nursery could use 1-4 cuttings per bag. In the beginning of growth, covering velocity of A. pintoi was lower than Mucuna pruriens, Calopogonium mucunoides, Centrocema pubescens.  Covering of A.pintoi could decrease the growth of broadleaf weeds, but not of grasses and sedges. In vanilla plantation, A pintoi grows well and produces biomass of 1.1 kg\/m2 with covering purity of 80%.\r\n\r\nKey Words: Arachis pintoi, sprout, cutting, cover velocity, purity, biomass",
