This\r\ncurrent research aims to intently find out the significant difference in the speaking achievement of the students who are taught\r\nthrough the modified think-pair-share based on suggestopedia and those who are taught through the original think-pair-share. This\r\nis a quasi-experimental research design that conducts a quantitative method. Subjects of this research are two classes of SMK N 3\r\nBandar Lampung. The finding shows that there is a significant difference in the increase of the score of experimental and control\r\nclass after the students are taught through the methods. The t-value is 2.687 at the significant level of 0.009 which is lower than\r\n0.05. Hence, it is concluded that applying the method of the modified think-pair-share based on suggestopedia principles can increase\r\nthe students’ speaking achievement.\r\nKEYWORDS: Game, Perception, Speaking Achievement, Suggestopedia, Think-Pair-Share.",

Therefore, the aims of this study were 1) to find out whether guided\r\nwriting using color code and guided question technique in teaching writing significantly enhances students’\r\nwriting ability, 2) to find out the aspects of writing ability enhanced the most significantly. The design was pre-\r\nexperimental with One Group Pre-Test and Post-Test Design. The subjects of this research were 25 students of\r\ntenth-grade students of SMAN 1 Kibang East Lampung-Indonesia. The writing test was administered to collect\r\nthe data. The results show that there is a significant difference between the students’ writing abilities after the\r\nimplementation of The Guided Writing Technique. It is revealed from the mean score of pre-test which is 53.8 and\r\nthe mean score of post-test which is 67.9. In addition, from the sig.2 tailed, it shows that the significant level is\r\n0.000. It means that the significant level is below 0.05. for the improvement of each aspect of writing ability. The\r\nresults shows that all sig. (2-tailed) value for each aspect is < 0.05 (0.000, 0.000, 0.002, and 0.000) except for\r\nmechanics (0.198). It means that all writing aspects assessed by the researcher enhanced significantly from the\r\npre-test to the post-test. then language use is the aspect of writing enhanced most. In conclusion, guided writing\r\nis an appropriate technique to enhance students’ writing ability.\r\nKeywords: Guided Writing, Guided Questions, Color Code, Students’ Writing Ability",
