      "abstract": "The objective of this study is to find out whether there is correlation between students’ morphological awareness and their English vocabulary size. Forty students at class XII IPA 3 of SMA Al-Azhar 3 Bandar Lampung were selected as the sample of this research. Ex Post Facto design was used in term of co-relational study. The data collection tools were Morphological Awareness Test and the Word Definition Matching Format (WDMF) test. \r\n \tThe result of calculation showed that coefficient correlation between students’ morphological awareness and their vocabulary size was 0.789 at significant level of 0.01. The coefficient correlation is higher than the critical value of r table (0.789 > 0.418). The simple regression analysis also was done to determine the influence of morphological awareness to student’s vocabulary size. The result showed that the coefficient determination was 0.623. It means that, morphological awareness influenced 62.3 % to vocabulary size. \r\n\r\nKey words: morpheme, morphological awareness, vocabulary size, correlation",
