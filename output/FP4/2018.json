      "abstract": "Coffee production system in Tanggamus was mostly cultivated around forest and Sekampung watersheds.  Upstream Sekampung watersheds had been threatened by land degradation and deforestation.  Trade-off have revealed between coffee production and ecological services in water catchment area.  Enhancing the coffee productivity must be concern with environment conditions.  Coffee agro forestry is well known as a great solution to improve the land productivity.   Environment services form natural resources will be assertion and sustainable. This study is concern to explore how the coffee agro forestry in land ownership performs.  Study taken place in Pulau Panggung sub district, Tanggamus.  Respondents choose randomly amount 408 coffee farmers.  Statistic descriptive used to tabulate and compile the coffee agro forestry perform criteria.  Then the relationship between land ownership and coffee agro forestry criteria related with farmer incomes, labor availability, level of education, and experiences in coffee production were analyzed by multiple regression.  Based on the analysis was revealed that coffee plant density amount 1.774 coffee trees.ha-1 while growth with shade trees (MPTS) attain to 187 trees.ha-1. MPTS based on wood represented by 8 kind of tress, while MPTS based on non-wood trees 5 type of trees.  Multi cropping plants also appear such as pepper, cocoa, banana, and rubber.  Adoption of Coffee agro forestry in Pulau Panggung sub district, Tanggamus was well performed. Farmer income was noted amount IDR 14.449.854,-.year-1 or IDR 1.204.155,-.month-1.  The coffee farmer income was significantly influenced by shade trees (MPTS), land ownership, and land area."

      "abstract": "In an attempt to obtain a cost-effective and a simpler way of growing Dendrobium seedling in vitro. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of basal media and organic additives on in vitro growth of Dendrobium seedlings. There were two factors treatment. The basal media used were first media containing half strength Murashige and Skoog (½ MS medium) and second media containing foliar fertililizer 32:10:10 and trace elements (FT medium). The organic additives were tomato, potato, mungbean sprout juice and banana homogenate. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with three replicates, 5 culture vessels per replicate and 4 seedlings ca. 1.5 cm per vessel. The experiment resulted that FT medium had significantly higher growth than ½ MS medium as indicated by seedling fresh weight. The media containing tomato juice led to the highest growth of seedling as shown by seedling fresh weight and seedling height. Since FT medium caused better growth than ½ MS medium, the FT medium could be used as a substitute for ½ MS medium for growing Dendrobium hybrid seedlings.The seedlings were successfully acclimatized in a shaded green house environment with 100% survival rate.\r\nKey Words: Orchids, cost-effective, propagation, tomato juice, foliar fertilizer.",
