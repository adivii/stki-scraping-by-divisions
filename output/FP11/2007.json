      "abstract": "Community forest in Indonesia is defined as ell forms of tree-stands located on the officially private owned areas and structuring ecosystem with its multi-functions covering ecological, economic as well as social aspects. Different local terms have been used for such inter-generational land use practices, such as talun, leuweung, wono, lembo, simpukng, repong, lombak, etc. The research which was conducted among three diffcrent ethnic groups of three separated villages in Central Lampung (2006-2007) have resulted among others that 77% of the total 32 respondents have generally implemented knowledge and skills in managing and conserving resources in term of community forest e.g. soil tillage, fertilizing, water-drainage development, plant-rotation, and pest\/disease control systems. However, in more detailed observation it was also found that every ethnic group has different approaches or technics. This situation has led to the conclusion that community based forest management or conservation policies formulation is indeed necessary to consider those local specific condition and capacities.",
