      "abstract": "Abstract: The objective of this research was to investigate the Science teachers' \r\nperception toward e-worksheet based on chiken manure waste treatment projects to \r\nimprove students' creative thinking skills. The method used in this research is mixed \r\nmethods with Sequential Explanatory Design. The data was collected through \r\nquestionnaire, then analyzed by using descriptive analysis. The questionnaires were \r\ndistributed to 14 Science teacher respondents and 127 junior high school students in \r\nNorth Metro District. The result shows that teacher have a positive perception toward \r\nusage of the electronic students' worksheets based on chiken manure waste treatment \r\nprojects. The results showed that 79% of teachers had not used project-based e�worksheets; based on students' response questionnaires, 37% of teachers have given \r\nproject assignments, but the projects were not based on real problems in the \r\nenvironment. Environmental problems that occur in North Metro District is the amount \r\nof chicken manure waste issue that causes pollution to the environment around society’s \r\nhouses. The current worksheets has not completely train students' creative thinking \r\nskills and that's skills was in low category. Based on the result It can be concluded that \r\na e-worksheet based on chiken manure waste treatment projects is needed to improve \r\nstudents' creative thinking skills.",

      "abstract": "This research describes the mental model of covalent bonding for high school and vocational high school students involving 240 respondents from 5 provinces in Indonesia, namely Sumatera Utara, Lampung, Bali, Kalimantan Timur, and Nusa Tenggara Timur. The results of this study are very useful for knowing the mental models of students, especially in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Students' mental model on understanding covalent bonds in this study, obtained by distributing questions to students, aims to determine the level of understanding of each student by involving three levels of chemical phenomena, namely macroscopically by explaining a brief description of the questions in each question, then sub macroscopic by asking students to describe the Lewis structure, as well as the symbolic level by solving the equation for the formation of compounds. Data were obtained from the covalent bond mental model results and the results of interviews with student representatives. Based on Park's mental model classification (2009) found that 32% of students had a second intermediate mental model, while 29% of pupils had the first intermediary mental model, and 39% of pupils had an initial mental model or an unformed mental model.",

This research aims to develop an entrepreneurship learning module with Virtual Reality-assisted Ethnopreneurship. This study adopted the research development of the Borg and Gall model using four stages (data collection, planning, product draft development, and field trials). The data was collected through instruments that included a literature review, an expert validity test, and a questionnaire followed by descriptive analysis. The results showed that developing entrepreneurship learning modules containing Ethnopreneurship assisted by Virtual Reality was effectively used in learning to increase entrepreneurial intentions. Research implications and recommendations are also discussed for future research.",

This research is a type of qualitative research with a case study approach, data collection techniques used are interviews (interviews), observation and documentation. Then to ensure the validity of the data using technical triangulation and source triangulation followed by data analysis with the research flow, namely identifying problems, determining research designs, determining research roles, determining data collection procedures, data recording, data analysis and verification, and narrating the research results obtained. The results of this research indicate that 54% of teachers have not used the PjBL learning model in learning and the teacher's perception of PjBL is good, but 62% of teachers do not know the PjBL syntax that must be fulfilled in using this learning model. In relation to scientific creativity, teachers do not know what indicators must exist in assessing students' scientific creativity. \r\nKeywords: Project Based Learning (PjBL); Scientific Creativity; Teacher Perceptions",

This compelling situation is not due to the COVID-19 pandemic alone but has become a necessity for every student from school to higher education. This article aims to analyze and explain understanding in education related to the concept of \"digital media\", and all student responses including \"learning styles\", and related concepts, by reviewing, and synthesizing the literature using in an integrative review. A total of 154 qualitative and quantitative articles published between 2000 and 2020 were reviewed. Based on the inclusion analysis, 25 articles reveal things related to \"digital media\" and the behavior of students' \"learning style\" responses and what digital learning media should be. Concerning what is embedded in digital media that can result in different reactions from one another, digital learning media should be made by considering the behavioral reactions of students' \"learning style\" responses. Applying various digital media such as online platforms or applications in learning should directly affect different learning styles in education. Learning variations should also be offered when the learning media is created and used.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to illustrate the effectiveness of the implementation of Pelangilla Ethnoscience Chemistry Learning in improving students’scientific process skills (SPS) through electrolyte and non-electrolyte solutions.The research method used is quasi-experimental with a pre-test and post-test control group design. The study population includes all her 10th graders from SMA Negeri 9 Bandarlampung. The study sample was drawn using a random sampling method and it was determined that her grade 1 at 4 IPA (science class) was the experimental class and her grade 5 at 5 IPA was the control class. An experimental class is a class that uses the Pelangiran Ethnoscience-based learning model for the learning method, and a control class is a class that uses the traditional model-based learning method. The survey data were analyzed using a separate test of the two means by independent sample t-tests. Results showed that the mean N-gain SPS was higher in the experimental class than in the control class. These results demonstrate that learning chemistry based on Pelangilla ethnoscience is effective in improving scientific process skills, especially in electrolyte and non-electrolyte solutions.",

This article reported the results of the development in the define stage. 10 teachers and 112 students in the Metro city, Indonesia were involved as research subjects. The questionnaire sheet was used to obtain data on the needs analysis of science worksheet based Lynk for elementary school. Based on the results of the research, it can be concluded that students need a worksheet based Lynk which are able to stimulate students learning, enhance students’ involvement in learning, and create a pleasant learning atmosphere. Based on the data, 82.73% of students agree for the necessity of a worksheet based Lynk development, with a validity value of 3.15 in the valid category and the reliability value of Cronbach’s alpha 0.928.",
