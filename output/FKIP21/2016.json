      "abstract": "The enthalpy concept and its change were introduced to describe the forms of internal energy transfer in\r\nchemical reactions. Likewise, the concepts of exothermic and endothermic reactions introduced as a consequence of heat\r\ntransfer form. In the heat measurement process at constant pressure, work is often ignored. The exothermic or\r\nendothermic reactions, usually only based on the increase or decrease of the reaction temperature, without associated\r\nwith the internal energy. Depictions of enthalpy and its change assumed closely related to students’ problem-solving\r\nability. Therefore, the study to describe pre-service chemistry teacher student’s conceptions and problem-solving ability\r\non topic chemical thermodynamics has been done. This research was a case study of chemical education course in\r\nProvinsi Lampung. The subjects of this study were 42 students who attend the chemical thermodynamics course.\r\nQuestions about exothermic and endothermic reactions, enthalpy and its change, as well as internal energy and its change\r\nwere given in the form of an essay exam questions. Answers related to conception qualitatively categorized, while\r\nproblem solving answers were scored and assessed. The results showed that, in general, students were having problems in\r\nenthalpy and describe the changes in the form of heat and work. The highest value of problem solving ability obtained\r\n26.67 from the maximum value of 100. The lowest value was 0, and the average value was 14.73. These results show that\r\nthe problem-solving ability of pre-service chemistry teacher students was low. The results provide insight to researchers,\r\nand educators to develop learning or lab work on this concept.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. This study aims at describing (1) students’ level comprehension; (2) factors causing difficulties to 3D\r\ncomprehend molecule representation and its interconversion on chirality. Data was collected using multiplechoice test\r\nconsisting of eight questions. The participants were required to give answers along with their reasoning. The test was developed based on the indicators of concept comprehension. The study was conducted to 161 college students enrolled in stereochemistry topic in the odd semester (2014\/2015) from two LPTK (teacher training institutes) in Bandar Lampung and Gorontalo, and one public university in Bandung. The result indicates that college students' level of comprehension towards 3D molecule representations and its interconversion was 5% on high level, 22 % on the moderate level, and 73 % on the low level. The dominant factors identified as the cause of difficulties to comprehend 3D molecule representation and its interconversion were (i) the lack of spatial awareness, (ii) violation of absolute configuration determination rules, (iii) imprecise placement of observers, (iv) the lack of rotation operation, and (v) the lack of understanding of correlation between the representations. This study recommends that learning show more rigorous \r\nspatial awareness training tasks  accompanied using dynamic visualization media of molecules associated. Also students\r\nlearned using static molecular models  can help them overcome their difficulties encountered.",

This research aims to apply simple graphi-cal visualization tool named Winplot for a learning exercise activity and explore its potency to counter misconceptions about orbitals and quantum numbers. Misconceptions that were countered in this research are the existence of orbitals \r\nin atoms and the relationship of magnetic quantum numbers to orbital orientation. This quasi experimental research using pre-test-post-test control group design was \r\nconducted to 43 first-year undergradu-ate students as control class and 45 as experimental class of chemical education at the University of Lampung. The students’ \r\npre-existing concepts were analyzed using a pre-test instrument and explored further using in-depth interview. Then, after im-plementing a learning exercise activity, the conceptual changes were analyzed using a post-test instrument. The results showed that students in experimental class had significant conceptual changes compared to control class. Applying this computer-based strategy is highly recommended to guide students in understanding chemical concepts, especially the topics of orbitals and quantum numbers.",
