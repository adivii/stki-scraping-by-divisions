      "abstract": "This study aims to compare the performance of\r\nmutual funds based on returns and risk, and also\r\nclassify the efficientcyof mutual funds based on the\r\nCapital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) method. The\r\nresearchâ€™ sample was 44 conventional equity mutual\r\nfunds, 9 sharia equity mutual funds, 44 sharia fixed\r\nincome mutual funds, and 9 sharia fixed income\r\nmutual funds. The research period is from 2017 to\r\n2018. The results show that the rate of return and risk\r\nbetween conventional mutual funds and sharia\r\nmutual funds are the same or have no difference.\r\nWhile the calculation of the rate of return and risk\r\nbetween equity funds and fixed income mutual funds\r\nalso shows that there are no differences between the\r\ntwo types of mutual funds. The classification of\r\nefficient mutual funds found that there were 15\r\nequityfunds and 40 fixed income mutual funds which\r\nwere included in efficient mutual funds. \r\n\r\nKeywords: Conventional mutual funds, Sharia\r\nmutual funds, Return, Risk, Capital Asset Pricing\r\nModel (CAPM).",
