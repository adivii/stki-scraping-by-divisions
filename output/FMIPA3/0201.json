It is a serious problem of the individual character and behavior that affect work, family and social life of a person. In many cases, the possibility of people do not realize that they have a personality disorder as a way of thinking and behaving seems natural to the patient, and the patient may blame others. To diagnose a personality disorder early, it is necessary to develop a system that is able to predict personality disorders and recommendation type of therapy patients should undergo. Artificial Intelligence is a technique that is very popular today. Various kinds of approaches and algorithms can be applied in the world of health, such as expert systems, neural networks and fuzzy logic. The aim of this study is to assess the artificial intelligence approach in predicting and recommending the type of therapy for patients with personality disorders.",
