      "abstract": "Emergence of drug resistant bacteria is one of the serious problems in today’s public health.\r\nHowever, the relationship between genomic mutation of bacteria and the phenotypic difference of them is still unclear. In this paper, based on the mutation information in whole genome sequences of 96 MRSA strains, two kinds of phenotypes (pathogenicity and drug resistance) were learnt and predicted by machine learning algorithms. As a result of effective feature selection by cross entropy based sparse logistic regression, these phenotypes\r\ncould be predicted in sufficiently high accuracy (100% and 97.87%, respectively) with less than 10 features. It means that we could develop a novel rapid test method in the future for checking MRSA phenotypes.",

The pattern of filter cloth is quite complex, unlike the pattern of fabric in general, with its own uniqueness that has become the culture of Lampung society until now. This filter cloth will be investigated by identifying the three types of filter cloth, namely Sasab, Bintang Perak and Gunung Beradu and see the results of its identification. The method used to identify is by combining the Gabor Filter feature extraction method which has frequency and orientation parameters and Probability Neural Network classification methods. Previously, the combination of these two methods was used to identify objects with simple patterns. The results are quite good, such as detecting faces, leaf patterns, and other simple patterns. This research is expected to get maximum identification results on the filter cloth even though it has a pattern that is not simple and will be used as a research report to determine the suitability of the method used for the filter object.",

Many variants of KP have been introduced for different real-world applications. Among them, the multiple-choice multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem (mm- KP) is the most complex model with an NP-hard problem. Several authors have reported the robustness of heuristics for mm-KP; irrespective of its advantages, no method currently has the ability to solve the problem optimally all time. This paper aims to determine the best GA strategy and evaluate the performance of several heuristic algorithms to solve mm-KP. We investigate the use of two techniques that are included in the GA approach. The first, two different strategies are adopted to handle infeasible chromosomes, namely penalty and repairing procedure. Second, we develop a new-simple local search to improve the quality of the solution found. Experimental studies on the 13 (thirteen) Benchmark instances are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach based on solutions quality, the number of the optimal solution reached, and average errors. The results showed that hr-GA tends to reach optimal\/nearoptimal solutions. Furthermore, the results from studies on heuristic algorithms also show that hr-GA is a promising approach, with local search used to immensely improve the quality."

      "abstract": "Tapis Fabric is a traditional clothing of the people of Lampung in the form of a shawl cloth or a sarong made of woven cotton thread with various motifs and ornaments, silver thread or gold thread by embroidered or punched. The pattern of filter cloth is quite complex, unlike the pattern of fabric in general, with its own uniqueness that has become the culture of Lampung society until now. This filter cloth will be investigated by identifying the three types of filter cloth, namely Sasab, Bintang Perak and Gunung Beradu and see the results of its identification. The method used to identify is by combining the Gabor Filter feature extraction method which has frequency and orientation parameters and Probability Neural Network classification methods. Previously, the combination of these two methods was used to identify objects with simple patterns. The results are quite good, such as detecting faces, leaf patterns, and other simple patterns. This research is expected to get maximum identification results on the filter cloth even though it has a pattern that is not simple and will be used as a research report to determine the suitability of the method used for the filter object.",

      "abstract": "The scheduling problem is known as one of the well-known optimization problems. It occurs in many situations of our daily-life applications, especially in industrial fields. One class of scheduling problems is called Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP). It belongs to the class of NP-complete problem. During the last decades, researches on exploring more accurate and efficient heuristic methods to solve hard optimization problems have taken considerable attention of researchers. Among them, GA has been one of the powerful and widely used algorithms. In this paper, we present two GA approaches to solve FSSP. Our main objective is to investigate the effectiveness and the efficiency of GA based on different variations of the chromosome representation, referred to as the job-based GA (jb-GA) and machine-based GA (mb-GA). We conducted numerical experiments using standard test problems (Benchmark test problems). We also compare the results with those given by another heuristic algorithm (NBH Algorithm) and the optimal solutions reported in the literature. Those demonstrate the jb-GA is more effective and efficient almost all of the time. The current limitation of this approach, like many other heuristic methods, is that it still sometimes gives the near-optimal solutions.",

      "abstract": "Gita Persada Butterfly Park is the only breeding of engineered in situ butterflies in Indonesia. It is located in Lampung and has approximately 211 species of breeding butterflies. Each species of Butterflies has a different texture on its wings. The Limited ability of the human eye to distinguishing typical textures on butterfly species is the reason for conducting a research on butterfly identification based on pattern recognition. The dataset consists of 600 images of butterfly’s upper wing from six species: Centhosia penthesilea, Papilio memnon, Papilio nephelus, Pachliopta aristolochiae, Papilio peranthus and Troides helena. The pre-processing stage is conducted using scaling, segmentation and grayscale methods. The GLCM method is used to recognize the characteristics of butterfly images using pixel distance  and Angular direction 0o, 45o, 90o and 135o. The features used is angular second moment, contrast, homogeneity and correlation. KNN classification method in this study uses k values1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 and 23 based on the Rule of Thumb. The result of this study indicate that Centhosia penthesilea and Papilio nephelus classes can be classified properly compared to the other 4 classes and require a classification time of 2 seconds at each angular orientation. The highest accuracy is 91.1% with a value of  in the angle of 90o and error rate8.9%. Classification error occured because the value of the test data features is more dominant with the value of the training image features in different classes than the supposed class.  Another reason is because of imperfect test data.",

      "abstract": "Goldfish (Carrasius auratus) is one of freshwater ornamental fishes\r\nthat has interested by community. The uniqueness of goldfish is\r\nbody shape, scale, and color. goldfish have similar morphology so\r\nmany goldfish enthusiasts and many goldfish fans and marine and\r\nfisheries biologists find it difficult to identify goldfish species.\r\nFantail, Oranda, dan Ranchu are three of 130 strains of goldfish that\r\nare difficult to identify. Canny Edge Detection is a feature extraction\r\nmethod that detects the edges of the goldfish image object. This\r\nresearch using 225 images of goldfish with 180 images for training\r\ndata and 45 images for testing data. Distribution of datasets used 5-\r\nfold cross validation. Clasification of goldfish image using PNN\r\nwith the great greatest accuracy is obtained at the smoothing value\r\n(σ) = 1.5 reaching 99.11%.",

The data used in this expert system consists of 7 diseases and 12 symptoms of oil palm\r\nplants. Expert system that is built on web-based using a rule with the Forward Chaining method to identify diseases.\r\nTesting has been done in two stages. They are internal testing and external testing. Internal testing consists of functional\r\ntesting and system expertise testing. Functional testing using the Black Box method with the Equivalence Patitioning (EP)\r\ntechnique shows that the developed system functions as expected. Expertise testing is done by comparing the results of\r\nthe diagnosis by the system and the results of the diagnosis by experts to produce a diagnosis of system expertise as\r\nexpected. External testing is done by giving questionnaires to 23 respondents who were divided into 2 groups to get an\r\nassessment of the system. The questionnaire results of the group I (Experts) obtained a satisfaction value of 81%, while\r\nthe group II (Students of the Department of Plantation Cultivation) obtained a satisfaction value of 75%.\r\nKeywords: Forward Chaining, Palm Oil Diseases, Rule, Expert System",

      "abstract": "Vanilla (Vanilla planifolia Andrews) is an industrial plant that has high economic value as a foreign exchange-producing export commodity that is still potential to be developed in Indonesia. Vanilla is widely used in Indonesia as an auxiliary material for the food industry and in fragrance medicine. However, the high demand for vanilla is not balanced with an adequate level of productivity due to several obstacles in the development of vanilla in Indonesia. The main cause of obstacles in vanilla cultivation in Indonesia is the lack of understanding of vanilla farmers regarding diseases that attack vanilla plants. Therefore in this study an expert system was built\r\nthat could diagnose vanilla plant diseases based on knowledge obtained from the experts directly. Expert system is built based on the web using the PHP programming language and Mysql database. The inference method used is\r\nthe Dempster-shafer method. In this study consisted of 5 diseases and 16 symptoms data. Test results show that: (1) Expertise testing by comparing the results of expert diagnoses and the system is appropriate and runs very\r\nwell with a total average accuracy of 99.50% (2) External testing using a questionnaire involving 20 respondents namely \"students of the Plantation Plant Cultivation\" show that the system built has an average total percentage\r\nvalue of 82.5% with the category \"Very Good\".\r\n\r\nKeywords: Expert System, Vanilla Plant Disease, Dempster-Shafer",

      "abstract": "Situs-situs e-commerce dan e-marketplace di Indonesia menawarkan setiap produk dengan deskripsi dan harga yang berbeda-beda. Oleh karena itu pengisian deskripsi dengan jumlah kata yang sangat banyak dan beragam, maka dapat menghabiskan waktu yang sangat lama dalam mengelola produk. Keterbatasan dalam mengelola deskripsi produk secara detail ini dapat diatasi dengan proses pengambilan informasi dengan web scraping. Web scraping adalah proses pengambilan sebuah dokumen semi-terstruktur dari internet, umumnya berupa halaman-halaman web dalam bahasa markup seperti HTML atau XHTML, dan menganalisis dokumen tersebut untuk diambil data tertentu dari halaman tersebut untuk digunakan bagi kepentingan lain. Pembangunan website ini dilakukan dengan menggunakan framework Laravel dan dengan metode pengembangan sistem waterfall. Hasil implementasi dari sistem informasi web scraping ini adalah teknik web scraping dapat digunakan untuk mengambil konten deskripsi produk dengan cepat dan tepat di berbagai situs e-commerce dan e-marketplace seperti Tokopedia, Bukalapak, Lazada, Zalora, Blanja.com, Kriya.co.id, Zilingo, Amazon, dan Alibaba yang memuat deskripsi penjualanan produk. Penyimpanan deskripsi produk ke dalam database, mempermudah transformasi data ke bentuk lainnya.",

      "abstract": "Indonesia adalah negara yang kaya akan keragaman budaya, salah satunya adalah bahasa daerah. Dalam Undang-Undang Republik Indonesia Nomor 24 tahun 2009 pasal 1 ayat ke 6, yang dimaksud bahasa daerah adalah bahasa yang digunakan secara turun-temurun oleh warga negara Indonesia di daerah daerah di wilayah Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia. Ada banyak bahasa daerah di Indonesia, salah satunya adalah bahasa lampung.  namun berkurangnya penutur bahasa lampung dapat mengakibatkan bahasa daerah lampung akan hilang. Dengan bantuan teknologi terutama Android, dapat membantu meningkatkan lagi minat berbahasa lampung terutama pada remaja lampung. penelitian ini akan mengembangkan aplikasi translator bahasa Indonesia ke Bahasa Lampung dialek A pada Platform Android. Aplikasi diberi nama Cawa Lampung. proses terjemahan dilakukan oleh sistem dengan terjemahan kata perkata. Setiap kata dilakukan proses stemming dengan mengunakan metode stemming Nazief Adriani. Metode pengembangan sistem yang digunakan yaitu eXtreme Programming. Dari hasil pengujian fungsional semua fungsi berjalan dengan baik, dan dari hasil non fungsional memiliki nilai 85.57 % yang memiliki makna “sangat baik”.",

Thus, needs bridges to meet the needs of the business world and education world through competency proficiency. The research aims are to generate a procedural model that show procedural steps that will guide when developing an assistance system for the competency proficiency test. We combine the model with blended\/hybrid learning as learning alternative in the era of industrial revolution 4.0. The Research and Development approach and the characteristics of the model developed in this study broadly combine three interrelated system development models, namely the Borg and Gall model as the backbone, Hanafin and Pack as the process of learning interaction and the Waterfall model as the creation of a companion application system. We also pay attention to the relationship between the share of academic, professional associations and government regulation in the form of the National Framework Scheme Indonesia (SKKNI) to the application of the results of this research is a Companion Certificate Diploma (SPKI) can do together. A procedural model is a development method of a mentoring framework which bridges industry and campus-based Ubiquitous Learning.",

      "abstract": "The University of Lampung especially Computer Science Departement has an online journal that publishes various scientific articles written by researchers both students and lecturers. This scientific article is called the online Computating Journal which is published once every 6 months. But, this online Computating Journal has not been structured and classified into the category of science that more specific. Therefore, in this research the abstract Computating Journal will be classified using text mining techniques to process the abstract become more structured and retrieve information in it. Then, the information in the abstract is extracted as a feature by the TFIDF weighting technique. The proposed classification model uses the support vector machine algorithm that has strong consistency. The model classification will be validated by applying the 10-Fold Cross Validation technique.",

      "abstract": "Carassius Auratus, also known as goldfish, is the most commonly kept ornamental fish  in  an  aquarium  that  has  a  variety  of  species,  shapes,  and  colors.  Goldfish anatomy is almost similar between species so it is difficult to distinguish. Goldfish identification has several processes to determine the level of success. One process that is very important for identification is segmentation. Segmentation is the stage to separate   objects   and   backgrounds.   Good   segmentation   results   will   provide maximum feature extraction results and it should impact on optimal identification results. This research aims to create a system that can be used to segment goldfish fish  objects  in  the  background   using  the  Expectation-Maximization  method. Expectation-Maximization is an algorithm for estimating a parameter in a function by using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Goldfish fish species total of 72 images  each  totaling  216.  Goldfish  segmentation  evaluation  results  using  the Expectation-Maximization method can work well with an accuracy rate of 89.14%. Analysis of the results of the imperfect fish image segmentation is influenced by white light and the background color is almost similar to that of the goldfish. The results of  the  best  goldfish  image  segmentation  are  influenced  by  a  good  goldfish  image when the image capture process at the time of the screenshot has a stable focus and is not blurry so that the edges of the goldfish object appear clearly and sharply.",

      "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is still a major problem in the public health sector, even in 2016 Indonesia was included in the five countries with the highest TB case burden in the world. In 2017, the number of TB cases in Lampung Province was 7,040 cases and one of the obstacles faced was the tendency for TB sufferers to be difficult to open so that many cases were not detected. Based on these facts, a Geographical Information System (GIS) is proposed which can process data into maps to see high risk areas where TB disease was found in Bandar Lampung. It will make it easier for health agencies to make policies in handling or preventing TB disease in Bandar Lampung. In this study, a decision-making system with Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method was also proposed to produce a map of the area with the level of TB risk factors. The criteria used to summarize the weights are TB cases, population density, mortality, healthy and clean behavior, and health facilities. The result of data processing is presented in a color polygon map that has 4 levels of risk factors, namely very high, high, medium, and low.",

With the advancement of technology, registration of prospective new students can access online registration which makes it easy to register. And now there needs to be a decision support system for prospective students in choosing schools according to the zoning mapping of the region. Then a decision support system is applied using the SAW (Simple Additive Weighting) method based on geographic information systems because the method is more appropriate in selecting criteria that are suitable for prospective students. In this case there are 3 (three) criteria contained in the system in the form of distance criteria, criteria for the difference in the number of UN scores of students with passing grade, and school quota criteria",

One of the activities carried out by the service is to make a Building Permit (IMB). Problems that are often experienced in spatial planning include irregular use of space and not in accordance with Building Permit and utilizing the use of space without regard to negative impacts on the surrounding environment. Especially in the trade and service area, most of Bandar Lampung City residents are engaged in industry, trade and services. In supporting the infrastructure of the development of activities in the field of Trade and Services, naturally effective and efficient development as a factor of economic growth for the region is needed. Therefore, as an element of service improvement in making permits to construct buildings, it needs tools in the form of technology. The technology in question is a website-based online licensing. With the advancement in technology, permit makers can access and submit licenses without being limited by distance, time and place. Then the integration of Geographic Information is applied to the Building Permit System for the Bandar Lampung City Trade and Services Area. In this system using the PHP programming language and Mariadb as the database. Testing using Black Box testing. In addition to the licensing process, this system also uses Google Maps Api as a geographic information feature in mapping building locations that have been submitted by permit makers. So that in addition to facilitating the applicant in the process of making permits, this system can also facilitate the Housing Settlement Office in monitoring and structuring the location of buildings in the Trade and Services area.",

      "abstract": "Accessibility of health services in Indonesia is still a problem. Health equity focuses on easy access and equitable distribution of health services and obtaining services with a standard quality set. Three dimensions of in-depth equity health can be divided into equity in health status, equity in health service use, and equity in health financing. The entire population is a health insurance participant. Health services that benefit packages include comprehensive services (preventive, promotive, curative, and rehabilitative). Government-owned health facilities must be provided, such as community health centers, clinics, doctors, hospitals, and financing paid by the government; the people who can afford it pay a premium. In this study, the accessibility of health services at hospitals and health centers in the city of Bandar Lampung was analyzed in geographic references by determining the distance and ranking health facilities ranging from very high to less accessibility value categories using the ARIA accessibility index calculation method. For hospital accessibility, Panjang district had the lowest index. Meanwhile, this district had a very high index for community health center accessibility compared to others. In health clinic accessibility, Teluk Betung Barat District had the lowest index, and Tanjung Karang Barat District had the highest index.",

Suppliers data is recorded in detail manually, as well as products recorded. Manual data collection can result in recording errors,  data easily tucked, or not recorded. This research develops an information system to help the company in data collection of suppliers and products automatically based on the web using Laravel as a framework. This system is built using extreme programming methods and has features that   focus on collecting suppliers,  products,  and product  shipments. The results of  system testing using the black box testing method shows that the system has fulfilled functional requirements and user needs.",

      "abstract": "This Decision Support System helps in determining school recommendations for prospective new students. Specifically to be able to enter one of 17 state high schools in the city of Bandar Lampung. This is intended to facilitate the ranking of the criteria for the acceptance of new students. So to determine the selection of new students in the field of education is needed a system that can help provide recommendations for school selection based on the zone area and can help determine more appropriate results. In accordance with PPDB 2018 regulations, the zoning system each education unit receives a minimum of 90% of prospective new students from the specified quota. Determination in determining a new student, then we need a decision support system with the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method. The SAW method requires the decision-maker to determine the weight of each criterion. The total score for the alternative is obtained by adding up all the multiplication results between the rating (which can be compared across attributes) and the weight of each criterion. This Decision Support System (SPK) will display the results in the form of a school name table with the highest to lowest percentage of the prospective students so that it will facilitate and assist prospective students in making decisions. By using the SAW method in the recommendation system for new students in Bandar Lampung, the aim is to make it easier for prospective new students to determine recommendations for selecting public schools based on zoning in Bandar Lampung.",

Apart from having good economic potential, this village has also run the village administration well. This condition is sufficient provision to transform Pekon Wonodadi into a smart village so that village services and functions can be even better. There are three elements that make up a smart village, namely government, society and the environment. All three elements must be accommodated by the smart village because they are an integral part of mutual influence. Conceptually, smart village is the management of resources by government agencies by utilizing technology in a sustainable manner. Based on the models and concepts described, this study aims to build a smart village implementation technology model that focuses on two elements of smart village, namely government and society by taking case studies in Pekon Wonodadi, Gadingrejo district, Pringsewu regency, Lampung Province.

      "abstract": "Katalog furniture hanya menampilkan barang–barang dalam bentuk 2 dimensi yang statis. Pembeli sering kali ingin melihat furniture yang dapat ditempatkan pada ruangan yang sesungguhnya. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengintegrasikan furniture 2D suatu katalog pada teknologi Augmented Reality (AR) sebagai suatu aplikasi yang berjalan pada platform Android. Aplikasi yang disebut Home-View ini dapat mengelola suatu gambar furniture 3D dengan ukuran yang dapat disesuaikan pada lingkungan yang nyata. Pengguna aplikasi ini dapat mengatur ulang ukuran produk furniture dan menampilkan objek tersebut pada lokasi yang diinginkan. Aplikasi Home-View dikembangkan dengan teknologi Augmented Reality. Pengembangan aplikasi menggunakan library Vuforia SDK dengan metode User-Defined Target (UDT) pada software Unity 3D. UDT digunakan agar aplikasi dapat menampilkan 3D furniture menggunakan gambar yang diinginkan pengguna sebagai target seperti sampul majalah atau buku. Aplikasi Home-View memiliki dua menu yaitu Marker Katalog dan Home View. Marker Katalog berfungsi untuk melihat 3D furniture dalam bentuk kecil pada catalog furniture. Home View berfungsi untuk melihat 3D furniture di dalam ruangan yang aktual. Aplikasi ini memiliki fitur positioning terhadap sumbu x dan y dan fitur rotating terhadap sumbu z. Aplikasi dapat bekerja dengan menampilkan 3D furniture sesuai ukuran aslinya pada menu Home View dan berhasil menampilkan 3D furniture sesuai dengan furniture yang ada pada katalog pada menu Marker Katalog.",

      "abstract": "Kedekatan dengan lembaga pendidikan SLTA, PTN maupun PTS seperti Universitas Lampung, UIN Bandar Lampung, Universitas Bandar Lampung (UBL) dan kedekatan dengan pusat bisnis, yakni pasar tradisional untung, minimarket dan kuliner malam memberikan peluang kepada masyarakat Desa Fajar Baru untuk dapat meningkatkan wirusaha. Produk-produk skala rumah tangga yang mempunyai peluang untuk dapat dikembangkan salah satunya adalah handsanitizer. Pada kondisi saat ini, dimana pandemi corona virus dieases (covid) 19 terus meluas, maka penggunaan handsanitizer sangat dibutuhkan sekali oleh masyarakat karena produk tersebut dapat memutus penyebaran covid 19. Tujuan dari kegiatan pengabdian kepada masyarakat ini adalah pendampingan kepada kelompok mitra, yaitu PKK Desa Fajar Baru dalam bentuk pelatihan dan pendampingan pembuatan produk handsanitizer berbasis alkohol. Bentuk kegiatan yang dilakukan adalah pendampingan, pelatihan, dan praktek. Hasil dari pelatihan dan pendampingan kepada kelompok mitra adalah keterampilan dan pengetahuan dalam pembuatan produk handsanitizer. Evaluasi kegiatan dilakukan dengan pengukuran terhadap pencapaian tujuan instruksional khusus dari kegiatan yang dilaksanakan dengan parameter pengukuran menggunakan pretest dan posttest untuk mengetahui Pengetahuan umum peserta tentang pembuatan dan fungsi handsanitizer, bahan baku untuk pembuatan dan merk produk. Hasil evaluasi menunjukkan bahwa pengetahuan mitra mengalami kenaikan 30% sampai 65% setelah mengikuti kegiatan pengabdian masyarakat tentang pembuatan handsanitizer",

      "abstract": "Several factors cause low quality and productivity of coffee in Indonesia. Pests and diseases are considered as two of the main reason for these factors. Most coffee farmers in Indonesia, particularly in Province of Lampung are undereducated farmers. They still use traditional practices to identify pests and diseases. Using an expert system, we hope that farmers can accurately diagnose coffee pests and diseases. The main goal of this research is to develop a web-based expert system to diagnose coffee pests and diseases. To identify the pests and diseases Breadth First Search (BFS) technique was implemented. The data consist of 5 pests, 5 diseases, 28 symptoms of pest, and diseases the coffee plant. Certainty factor is used to weight the symptoms and it was determined by experts and the user. Then the certainty factor is iteratively computed the system to measure the likelihood of the diagnosis. To evaluate this system, 30 users were chosen and grouped into three clusters (the coffee experts, farmers, and agriculture students, computer science students). They were asked to assess this expert system by fulfilling questionnaires. They inferred that this system runs well with percentage respectively 75.56%, 73.78%, and 83.39%."

      "abstract": "As one of the most important Post-Translational Modification (PTM), phosphorylation is responsible for cellular signaling pathways and activation of enzymes. With current computational power and algorithm, it is possible to process big data, especially biomedical data, to find a complicated pattern with reasonable computation time. Computational approach for phosphorylation site prediction is more time-efficient and need fewer resources com-pared to traditional. However, the accuracy of current computational methods for phosphorylation site prediction still needs to be improved. This paper aims to create a computational method for phosphorylation site prediction with better classification performance compared to previous studies. The data used in this research to train the XGBoost models are extracted features from 2 different databases from the previous studies. The test result show that our model gave the highest accuracy on 4 out of 6 datasets. To extend our research, the XGBoost model was retrained which focused on 100 most important features from previous experiment. However, the result does not imply that it has a better result compared to our first models. As the result showing that our models gave better ac-curacy compared to the previous studies in most of the datasets, we can conclude that XGBoost model is better in predicting phosphorylation sites compared to other methods.",

The system is pervasive in helmets and motorcycles with several main electronic components, including NodeMCU microcontroller, accelerometer-gyroscope sensor, a GPS (Global Positioning System) module, flex sensor, buzzer, and relay. Then helmet, motorcycles, and riders to connect with others through the internet with the android application interface. The application can monitor real-time status and location riders using firebase real-time database. This system has four features: a combination of previous related works, namely helmet detection, drowsiness detection, accident detection, and notification with the accident's location that can be tracked by others. The results of this system prototype experiment show that all features of the system are running well. The accuracy value for helmet detection is 100%, drowsiness detection is 87%, and accident detection is 90%. Rider status and location can be monitored and tracked by others via the android application.",

Used goods such as books, clothes, bags, shoes that are still suitable for use, can also be donated to others needy. In the current technological development, many donations have been made online. This can provide donors and social institutions in raising donations. But the donations consist only of money and are not goods. In overcoming this, the eDonation apps can help donors in donating their used goods. This application also helps social institutions in raising broader donations. By utilizing location-based services, donors can find out the location of social institutions in the vicinity, so donors can choose the location of the nearest social institution that receives donations in the form of used goods that are suitable for use.",

      "abstract": "ini dilakukan untuk mengevaluasi usability sistem digital repository Universitas Lampung menggunakan metode user experience. Penelitian ini menggunakan alat survei berupa kuesioner dan objek pada penelitian ini adalah sistem digital repository Universitas Lampung. Kuesioner yang digunakan mengacu pada Standard Usability Questionnaires, yaitu Software Usability System (SUS). Kuesioner disebarkan secara online kepada 100 responden yang terdiri dari 10 pernyataan untuk memberikan pandangan secara menyeluruh. Kuesioner SUS dapat diisi dalam waktu yang singkat dan skala yang digunakan dalam kuesioner SUS adalah skala likert dengan penilaian 5 skala likert, dimana skala 1 mengisyaratkan ketidak setujuan yang kuat dan skala 5 menunjukkan persetujuan yang kuat, selanjutnya hasil dari survei kuesioner tersebut dianalisis untuk dapat dijadikan sebagai masukan dalam pengembangan dan perbaikan sistem digital repository Universitas Lampung. Penelitian ini juga menggunakan data dari Google Analytics sistem digital repository Universitas Lampung yang kemudian dianalisis menggunakan User Persona untuk mempelajari kepribadian pengguna yang digambarkan melalui responden. Hasil dari penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa jumlah nilai dari 100 tanggapan responden adalah 6.282,5 dengan nilai rata-rata yaitu 62,825. Nilai rata-rata ini kemudian disimpulkan berdasarkan penilaian pada kuesioner SUS yang dibagi menjadi tiga kategori, yaitu berdasarkan kategori acceptability ranges yang termasuk kedalam batas bawah high level, sedangkan berdasarkan kategori grade scale mendapatkan nilai D dan berdasarkan kategori adjective ratings mendapatkan nilai OK. Nilai rata-rata sistem digital repository Universitas Lampung berada dibawah nilai standar rata-rata pada banyak penelitian, yaitu 68 yang berarti terdapat masalah pada usability dan sistem harus dilakukan perbaikan untuk meningkatkan nilai usability.\r\nKata Kunci : usability, sistem digital repository, user experience, kuesioner.",

In the Computer Science Department, theses are managed by the thesis coordinator. Thesis coordinator has several tasks, including monitoring the thesis progress of each student. However, in practice, the monitoring process can not be performed easily. Therefore, a thesis monitoring information system is expected to support the thesis coordinator and thesis supervisors in the Computer Science Department on conducting thesis monitoring, as well as accommodating students in terms of administration ease. This research has successfully generated a Thesis Monitoring Information System developed according to the user requirements, by implementing PHP, MySQL, and Nexmo API.",

Pekon memiliki Luas 5,12 km² dengan jumlah penduduk 3520 jiwa yang terdiri dari 704 kepala keluarga. Potensi Sumberdaya Alam adalah pertanian dengan produk unggulan beras\/padi. BUMDES pekon wonodadi juga bergerak dalam bidang jasa simpan pinjam, bidang perdagangan dan bidang penyewaan. Jika Merujuk Undang-Undang nomor 6 tahun 2014 tentang Desa maka menjadi peluang yang sangat besar bagi setiap desa yang ada di Indonesia khususnya Pekon Wonodadi untuk bisa mengembangkan setiap potensi yang dimilikinya secara mandiri sesuai kebutuhan dalam rangka mewujudkan kesejahteraan masyarakat. Namun ada kendala utama yang dihadapi pekon wonodadi dalam meningkatkan kesejahteraan masyarakatnya. Kendala tersebut adalah konsep pemasaran produk barang dan jasa masih dilakukan secara konvensional. Teknik pemasaran ini dirasa kurang efektif sehingga diperlukan teknik pemasaran lain yang lebih kreatif dan menarik yaitu menggunakan video profile. Pelatihan pembuatan video profile untuk usaha kecil dan menengah diharapkan dapat meningkatkan kesejahteraan masyarakat pekon Wonodadi. video profile di upload pada website resmi pekon Wonodadi.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. The scheduling problem is known as one of the well-known optimization problems. It\r\noccurs in many situations of our daily-life applications, especially in industrial fields. One type\r\nof scheduling problem is called Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP).  It belongs to the class\r\nof NP-complete problem. During the last decades, researches on exploring more accurate and\r\nefficient heuristic methods to solve hard optimization problems have taken considerable attention\r\nfrom researchers. Among them, GA has been one of the powerful and widely used algorithms.  In\r\nthis paper, we present two GA approaches to solve FSSP. The main objective is to investigate the\r\neffectiveness and the efficiency of GA based on different variations of the chromosome\r\nrepresentation, referred to as the job-based GA (jb-GA) and machine-based GA (mb-GA). We\r\nconducted numerical experiments using standard test problems (Benchmark test problems). We\r\nalso present the comparison of results with those given by another heuristic algorithm (NBH\r\nAlgorithm) and the optimal solutions reported in the literature. Those demonstrate the jb-GA is\r\nmore effective and efficient almost all of the time. The current limitation of this approach, like\r\nmany other heuristic methods, is that it still sometimes gives the near-optimal solutions. \r\n\r\nKeyword: genetic algorithm, scheduling, benchmark, flow shop",

The need for comprehensive business modeling of the realization of the solution is needed so that it can be clearly visualized, assessed, and validated based on the requirements of specific prospective users. Modeling of  startup  candidates  for  skilled  business  needs  to  be  analyzed  appropriately  so  that  skilled  can  be  commercialized globally. This study uses a customer development model or CDM approach to analyze and determine business modeling based on problems faced by specific potential users. User needs are obtained by conducting direct interviews, then the business modeling process is carried out with Lean Canvas through lowering the formulation of solutions for user needs. This approach is implemented through two stages, the stage ofcustomer discovery and the stage of customer creation. The stages of customer discovery generate facts about potential user problems that are used to form value proportions. Whereas  the  customer  creation  stage  is  carried  out  gathering  user  needs.  The  formulation  of  the  developed  business model is then validated through expert judgment to get an assessment. Based on expert judgment, it is known that Skilled business modeling is in accordance with the needs of specific prospective users. However, a renewal of features and a more detailed analysis of the feasibility study is needed to complete this skilled business development analysis",

      "abstract": "Aplikasi  Terampil  adalah  aplikasipendidikanketerampilan online dan offline serta  sertifikasi  profesi berbasis android yang fokus pada bidang non akademik yang mempermudah masyarakat Indonesia untuk menerapkan dan  mengembangkan  keterampilannya.  Aplikasi  Terampil  merupakan  aplikasi  prototipe  yang  akan  dikembangkan menjadi aplikasi yang siap pakai. Supaya aplikasi tersebut nyaman dan mudah untuk digunakan sebelum siap pakai, maka perlu dilakukan analisis dan perancangan user interface (UI)dan user experience (UX)serta evaluasi supaya aspek –aspek usability sesuai  dengan  keinginan  dan  kebutuhan  pengguna. Analisis  dan  perancangan  UI  dan  UX menggunakan metode The Wheel dan usability testing menggunakan metode Heuristic Evaluation.Tujuan penilitian ini adalah untuk mendapatkan desain interface dan experience yang baik dan benar sesuai dengan keinginan pengguna. Aplikasi  Terampil  memiliki  dua  modul  yaitu  peserta  kursus  dan  instruktur  keterampilan.  Pengumpulan  data  awal dilakukan dengan melakukan wawancara dan kuisioner online untuk mendapatkan kebutuhan fungsional, kemudian dilanjutkan dengan pembuatan desain tampilan berdasarkan kebutuhan fungsional. Desain tampilan dievaluasi oleh responden  melalui  pengujian prototyping untuk  mendapatkan feedback, sehingga  sesuai  dengan  keinginan  dan kebutuhan  pengguna.  Tahap  terakhir  yaitu  pengujian  kebergunaan  atau usability  testing menggunakan  10  elemen heuristic yang  dilakukan  dengan  bantuan evaluator. Berdasarkan  evaluasi  dari  metode The  Wheelyang  sudah dilakukan, responden mengharapkan desain interfaceyang mudah dan nyaman digunakan serta informatif sehingga pengguna  tidak  kesulitan  untuk  memahami  aplikasi  yang  akan  digunakan.  Sedangkan  berdasarkan  pengujian kebergunaan  atau usability  testingmenggunakan heuristic  evaluationyang  sudah  dilakukan,  ketiga  evaluator memberikan evaluasi untuk memperbaiki pemilihan warna tombol, pemilihin icon, dan konsistensi desain interface supaya pengguna tidak kesulitan dan bingung saat menggunakan aplikasi Terampil.",

This system is designed to control and monitortemperature and humidity parameters in each kumbung. The system consists of several nodeboards in each kumbung and master board. The main components of the node board consist ofArduino Uno which is connected to XBee, DHT22 sensor, actuator in the form of a sprayerpump,a blower and lamp. The main components of the Master board are Raspberry Pi andXbee. Data is sent from each node to the Master using the WSN network with data packagesthat contain temperature and humidity data with the ID of each kumbung. The master boardsends all kumbung data through a WiFi network to the Firebase realtime database that can bemonitored via a smartphone. Kumbung control is performed by an actuator at each board node.The actuator keeps the temperature betwen 26-290C and the humidity betwen 70-90%RH formushrooms in the phase of body formation. The results of this system prototype experimentshow that the functionality of the system is running well, although there is an average error0,4650C for temperature readings and an average error 2,67% for humidity readings. This erroris still in the DHT22 working area based on the datasheet",

      "abstract": "The industrial era 4.0 has brought various challenges such as technology, strategy, business and people, where people or human resources become one of the main assets in a company and  significantly  determine  competitive  advantage  in  the  market.  Not  only  that,  but  also because  the  dynamics  of  change  in  the  labour  market  are  getting  faster,  which  means outdatedfrom existing competencies and increasing demand for new competencies. Sharing research  and  previous  literacy  is  an  inspiration  to  create  and  develop  a  system  that  has collaborative  learning  capabilities  with  various  stakeholders,  various  teaching  materials  or content provided, as well as various services in learning innovation. The primary foundation of  the  system  created  in  this  study  based  on  Ubiquitous  Learning  by  combining  three interrelated system development models between the Borg and Gall model asthe backbone, Hanafin  and  Pack  as  the  learning  interaction  process  and  the  Waterfall  model  of  the accompanying  application  system  built.  The  establishment  of  the  Conceptual  Model  and Procedural  Model  in  a  digital  learning  platform  from  national  and  international  standard certification  programs  based  on  Profession  and  Competence  provided  by  industry  and associations, bridging the industrial and campus worlds to opportunities for new paradigms in the educational business process that will ultimately impact by increasing the competency ability  of  human  resources  in  the  field  of  informatics  also  students  and  lecturers  in Indonesian informatics and computer education.",

      "abstract": "This article focuses on how video games may trigger empathy. On the one hand, globalization and our fast-changing, globalized world have resulted in an empathy deficit, a situation that calls desperately for a new approach to tackle the empathy issue. On the other hand, recent statistical data has shown that players in some countries today spend on average more than 4 h weekly playing games. Most past research has found that playing violent games decreases pro-social behavior. However, only a few studies investigate the effects of neutral or pro-social video games. Our study aims to identify several characteristics of four games that seem to promote positive moral and empathy and involves 40 subjects. Specifically, we look into the effects of variation of number of interventions and the correlation with perceived presence and immersion. The research reported in this paper covers background and related work on empathy research, existing work on video games for experiencing empathy and the layout of the study. The findings of this initial study on four pro-social games suggest that sufficient story-line of video games can positively impacts aspects such as the ‘perspective taking’ of players. Findings also indicate that multiple interventions and higher perceived immersion dent to increase the level of empathy. This research may contribute to supporting the promotion and development of the ‘games for good’ or ‘games for change’ campaign.\r\n\r\nKeywords\r\nEmpathy Pro-social Video games Immersive Presence",

Most patient's family are lacking\r\nthe knowledge on how to assess the patient in the post-treatment\r\nperiod is one main factor of this problem, causing many posttreatment\r\npsychiatric patients left ignored. A proper implementation\r\nof information technology can resolve this problem by developing\r\nan application that can help the patient's family indirectly connected\r\nwith the hospital or health center, making the communication in the\r\npost-treatment period easier. However, several aspects need to be\r\ncarefully prepared when building a software, including determining\r\nthe interface and functions available within the application. The\r\ndeveloper must understand the user requirements in using the\r\napplication, as well as how to make it user friendly. Therefore the\r\ndesign process is an important measurement tool in terms of\r\nsoftware development. One method that can determine the user\r\nrequirement is the User-Centered Design method. This method\r\ndirectly involves the user at an early stage of software development\r\nso that the users can tell what they need in the application, provide\r\nsuggestions for the interface design, and fill in the usability scale\r\nsystem questionnaire to help the developer assess whether the\r\nCode : INF_07\r\nBook of Abstracts - Informatics | 100\r\ninterface design is acceptable or not. This study successfully\r\ndeveloped the interface design of JiwaMuKu application and has\r\nbeen able to meet all the user requirements by using the User-\r\nCentered Design method. The interface design test was carried out\r\nusing the system usability scale and scored 75.33 which is\r\nconsidered good and acceptable for further development.\r\nkeyword : user-centered design, mental disorder, system usability\r\nscale, user interface, user experience,",

The situation has resulted in a high level of customer migration, affecting a decrement toward the company revenue. Regarding that condition, the customer churn is one well-know approach that can help in increasing the company's revenue and reputation. As to predict the reason behind the migration of customer, this study proposed a data mining classification technique by applying the C4.5 algorithm. Patterns generated by the model were implemented using 10-fold cross-validation, resulting in a model with an accuracy rate of 87%, precision 87.5%, and a recall of 97%. Based on the good performance quality of the model, it can be stated that the C4.5 algorithm succeeded to discover several causes from the migration of telecommunication users, in which price holds the top place as the primary reason.\r\nKeywords: C4.5 Algorithm; Classification; Customer Churn; Data Mining",
