In addition, these skills develop a conducive culture to achieve\r\nschool vision in the industrial revolution 4.0 era. Hence, the purpose of this study\r\nis to analyze and map the level of leadership skills as the technical, conceptual,\r\nand human skills corresponding to the 21st-century literacies, i.e., data, technol-\r\nogy, and human, respectively. Note that the method applied in this research is a\r\ndescriptive quantitative collected using a questionnaire from 112 certified elemen-\r\ntary school teachers in Bandar Lampung City. Then, we categorize the collected\r\ndata based on the skills and Likert scale. The results show that the average level\r\nof leadership skills of elementary school principals for the technical skills is the\r\nlowest, while for the human skills is higher than conceptual skills. In addition,\r\ntechnical skills are inversely proportional to human skills. Furthermore, the con-\r\nceptual skills increase linearly according to the duration of experiences. Every\r\naspect of the principal skills at each level of school accreditation is in the vulnera-\r\nble score of 2.85–3.19 which is categorized as good. While the technical skills at\r\na score of 2.75 are categorized as sufficient. We expect that this research can con-\r\ntribute the recommendations to the government to provide the program to increase\r\nthe leadership competency of the elementary school principals.\r\nKeywords: Elementary school principals · descriptive quantitative · leadership\r\nskills · likert scale · 21st-century literacies",
