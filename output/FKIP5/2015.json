      "abstract": "This study was devoted to show how scaffolded teachers promote their content knowledge, modify scaffolding model that really fits in teacher‟s profile in developing countries. A modified scaffolding, teacher-based scaffolding (TBS), has been developed as an alternative for developing countries. The distinction between the TBS and the existing scaffolding relies on teacher‟s need guided by the assigned expert, group facilitation and peer mentoring, as well as assessment and feedback extension. The result suggests that TBS could promote teachers‟ content knowledge. \r\n\r\nKeywords: teacher development; training model; scaffolding; teacher-based scaffolding",

Parent involvement in education is believed to benefit both students’ academic and non-academic learning outcomes. This study was intended to explore Dual-Mode Parent Involvement (DMPI) in the framework of good governance at school. Six elementary schools appointed as the pilot project for good governance in one of benchmarked cities of education were selected in the study. The subjects of the research were the School Development Teams (SDT) comprising parents, teachers, as well as headmasters. In a Focused-Group Interview (FGI) setting, they were explored to share their experiences on parent involvements in the good-governed schools. The research finding suggests that in the framework SGG, DMPI can be best integrated in the transformational process in the school. This type of involvement is believed to have better impacts for the student learning outcomes. \r\n\r\nKeywords: Dual-mode, parent involvement, good",

In this paper we report the evaluation of a professional development program to improve content knowledge for 147 Indonesian teachers. The teachers were divided into three experimental groups, and each group was treated to one of the three professional development models frequently used in developing countries. The results showed that all three models led to improvement in the teachers’ content knowledge; however, the teacher-based scaffolding model proved to be the most effective. In our account of why this program of teacherbased scaffolding was successful, we compared it with other studies.",

      "abstract": "Tujuan umum penelitian ini adalah untuk mengembangkan model good governance Sekolah Dasar (SD) melalui penguatan peran komite sekolah. Sedangkan tujuan khusus yang ingin dicapai adalah untuk: (a) menguatkan peran komite sekolah dalam membentuk good governance sekolah dasar, yang mencakup: memberi nasehat, medukung, mengontrol, dan mediator atau penghubung. Kondisi ini akan dijadikan bahan untuk mengembangkan Model Good Governance Sekolah Dasar (SD) Melalui Penguatan Peran Komite Sekolah di Kota Metro; (b) mengimplementasikan Model Good Governance Sekolah Dasar (SD) Melalui Penguatan Peran Komite Sekolah di Kota Metro, yang akan berdampak pada kualitas sekolah secara keseluruhan. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode penelitian pengembangan (Research and Development) yang dikembangkan oleh Borg dan Gall yang dilaksanakan dalam dua tahun kegiatan. Tahun pertama: tahap pengembangan model, berdasarkan data yang diperoleh dilakukan seminar terhadap model awal, merancang model awal, studi banding, merevisi, dan menghasilkan model good governance sekolah melalui penguatan peran komite sekolah. Tahun kedua: mensosialisasikan model good governance sekolah, melakukan uji coba model, memvalidasi dan merevisi model, mengimplementasikan model. Telah dihasilkan model Good Governance Sekolah Dasar (SD) Melalui Penguatan Peran Komite Sekolah di Kota Metro. Dengan hasil ini kiranya dapat menjadi Benchmark untuk sekolah lain dalam membentuk good governance sekolah.\r\n\r\nKata kunci: good governance sekolah, peran komite sekolah\r\n\r\nThe general objective of this research is to develop good governance model of primary school (SD) by strengthening the role of the school committee. The specific objectives to be achieved are to: (a) strengthening the role of the school committee in the form of good governance in primary schools, which include: give advice, endorse, control, and mediator or communicator. This condition will be used as material to develop good governance model of Primary School (SD) by Strengthening the Role of the School Committee in Metro City, (b) implement the Good Governance Model of Primary School (SD) by Strengthening the Role of the School Committee in Metro City, which will have an impact on the quality of the school as a whole. This research used developmental research method (Research and Development) developed by Borg and Gall conducted in two years of activity. First year: model development stage, based on the data obtained, the seminar on early models was done, designing the initial model, a comparative study, revise, and produces good governance model by strengthening the role of school committees. Second year: socialize the good governance model, test the model, validate and revise the model, implement the model. The expected outcome of this research is the establishment of Good Governance Model of primary school (SD) by Strengthening the Role of the School Committee in Metro City. From this result, it seems to be a Benchmark for other schools in forming good governance school.\r\n\r\nKeywords: good governance, the role of school committee",
