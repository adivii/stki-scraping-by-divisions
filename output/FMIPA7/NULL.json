      "abstract": "Shrimp shell is one of the potential sources for the production of chitin which can be converted into its \r\nderivative products, namely glucosamine and oligosaccharides. This study aims to study the \r\ndegradation of shrimp shells by actinomycetes into chitin derivative products. Actinomycetes \r\n19C38A1 were obtained from the UPT LTSIT deposit. Furthermore, actinomycetes were cultured \r\nusing a solid state fermentation method using shrimp shell media. The fermentation process on the \r\nsurface of the shrimp shells was observed using the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) technique. \r\nThe fermentation results were analyzed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The \r\nresults of the observation of the surface morphology of the shrimp shells showed that there was \r\ndegradation of the shrimp shells. The interpretation of the analysis data of fermented products \r\nshowed the formation of glucosamine of 29 mg. Further analysis on days 6 and 8 showed a decrease \r\nin glucosamine levels by 20 mg and 15 mg, respectively. Based on the results obtained, it can be \r\nconcluded that 19C38A1 isolate was able to convert shrimp shells into derivative products of \r\nglucosamine and chitin through solid fermentation using shrimp shells. This basic information is very \r\nimportant for further studies related to the development of fermentation methods.",
