      "abstract": "Professional educators are required to develop a learning model that was based on a constructivist understanding. This study aimed to obtain the indicators needed to measure a learning model developed by educators in all types and levels of education. Indicator is intended to evaluate the components of a learning model.\r\nThe method used in this research is quantitative descriptive. Data was collected by the Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with three steps; a preliminary investigation, design, and realization \/ construction. It was involving six experts and four practitioners. Validation of the construct is in the form of expert judgment. The opinions of experts and practitioners were analyzed descriptively, while the reliability of the instrument was analyzed by Cronbach's Alpha.\r\nThe results showed that there were 7 indicators of learning model developed from five aspects;  rational theoretical (2 indicators and 11-item criteria), syntax (1 indicator and three item criteria), the principle of interaction (1 indicator and 7 item criteria), social systems ( 1 indicator and three item criteria) and the impact of learning (2 indicators and criteria item 7). The measurement results were using 3-scale models of learning; 1 (= if the indicator is less good \/ less logical), 2 (= if the indicator is good enough \/ illogical) and 3 (= if the indicator is good \/ logical). Assessment categories were grouped into three; No Good (TB), Good (B) and Very Good (SB).  Reliability value questionnaires are rational theoretical aspects of 0.89, the syntax of 0.81, 0.93 interaction principle, the social system and the impact of learning 0.86 0.84. Based on reliability testing all aspects of the value of Cronbach's Alpha of 0.94, thus all items contained in the questionnaire are reliable and all indicators internally consistent because they have a strong reliability.",

The method used in this research was quantitative research with a correlation design. The population were all students of class V with the number of students were 90 students and also as sample of the research. The results of the data analysis technique which used product moment correlation formula obtained the r count = 0.848, which means the correlation is positive. In addition, tcount is greater than ttabel or 22.594 > 1.987 so, H0 is rejected and Ha which states there is a significant relationship between learning motivation and students' achievement of social studies of fifth grade students. Masalah dalam penelitian ini adalah hasil belajar IPS siswa yang rendah dan  motivasi belajar yang masih rendah pada siswa kelas V SD Negeri 1 Sawah Lama Kota Bandar Lampung Tahun Pelajaran 2015\/2016. Tujuan dalam penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui hubungan antara motivasi belajar dengan hasil belajar IPS siswa. Metode penelitian yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah kuantitatif dan desain yang digunakan adalah penelitian korelasi. Populasi dalam penelitian ini adalah seluruh siswa kelas V dengan jumlah 90 siswa yang sekaligus menjadi sampel penelitian. Hasil dari teknik analisis data yang menggunakan rumus korelasi product moment diperoleh r hitung = 0,848 yang berarti korelasi tersebut positif. Selain itu, lebih besar dari  atau 22,594 > 1,987 sehingga, H0 ditolak dan Ha yang berbunyi ada hubungan yang signifikan antara motivasi belajar dengan hasil belajar IPS pada siswa kelas V.\r\n                                            \r\nKata kunci: hasil belajar, IPS, motivasi belajar",
