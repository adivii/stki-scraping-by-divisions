      "abstract": "Global buyer’s concern towards sustainability production become a necessity recently, including in global market of coffee. Enhancing the coffee productivity must be a concern with sustainability condition. Coffee agroforestry is well known as a great solution to improve land productivity. Environmental services from natural resources will be assertion and sustainable. The aims of this study were to examine the agroforestry practices and to analysis the primary determinant of coffee farmer income. A study took place in Pulau Panggung sub-district, Tanggamus. Respon- dents were chosen randomly in a number of 408 coffee farmers. Descriptive statistic was used to tabulate and compile the coffee agroforestry performance criteria. Multiple regressions were conducted to analysis the relationship between coffee farmer incomes with the main determinant factors. Based on the analysis revealed the coffee-based complex agroforestry was a type of coffee agroforestry system in Pulau Panggung sub-district. Coffee plant density was 1,719 trees.ha-1   plants with multi purpose tree species (MPTS) shade trees 182 trees.ha-1. The MPTS as shade trees density in coffee farming attaint to 10.5%, and raised more than five types of shade plants. Based on the regression model analysis results that simulta- neously independent variables land area, land tenure, MPTS, education level, and experience in coffee planting were influenced the coffee farmer income model. Increased performance of coffee agroforestry system has a positive relation with the farmer income. This finding is very strategic to support the fact that the sustain- able production trough coffee agroforestry was well-practiced by society forest (hutan kemasyarakatan). Development of the coffee agroforestry system in promoting the environmental services linked with the upper Sekampung watersheds manage- ment is becoming a critical step in the future.\r\n\r\nKeywordsz:  Coffee,  agroforestry,  Sekampung  watersheds,  land tenure",
