It bases its understanding on the premise that urban resiliency act as an agent of cultural heritage inventory which are completed by building category, facade, typology, structure, social cultural and human behavior. This research proposes the first step of an innovative methodological approach to develop an information system, and to stimulate identification of “flag” all traditional houses in database's management. Moreover, we deliver opportunity and challenge to implement IoT in cultural heritage inventory. Collectively view these possibility to adapt, protect, and preserve local community knowledge, traditional technique and traditional houses that as part cultural identity in the future. As a case study, we present three layer inventory which integrates IoT for sustainable cultural heritage, especially traditional houses in Bandar Lampung, Indonesia",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Facing vulnerability of vernacular architecture existences, resilience capacity planning is involved as a strategic requirement for new established ecosystems of human settlement. In this context, vernacular architecture, is tangible and more intangible constitute an important research field as is demonstrates a great capacity to evolve and adapt itself to the changing external conditions, as it is a result of several cycles of global change. Vernacular architecture of Lampung is an outstanding example of the adaptation to specific environmental conditions. The vernacular architecture provides excellent shelter from the hot and humid tropical climate. A comprehensive understanding of correlation between resilience and vernacular architecture was created by ordered identify and examine of local community traditions, spatial arrangement land use and building culture that have elected resilience capacity. In this case, Vernacular Architecture existences can be approved as “resilient “that is influenced by dynamic factors such as “macro climate”, “environmental materials” and “living cultures”. Furthermore, vernacular architecture is demonstration of identify and to developed sustainability through time. This paper investigates current relationship between vernacular architecture, resilience and sustainability, a literate review was undertaken including analysis of vernacular architecture history; philosophy, theory, principle, concept and regulation of integrate urban conservation and preservation. Knowledge of vernacular architecture preservation can provide guidance on the building design and construction policy as sustainable development that aim to increase the capacity of social-ecological system to respond and to adapt environmental and socio- economic stressors. With this paper, we aim a basis for measuring the resilience of urban system according to sustainable development for historical heritage and resilient approach that has applied in vernacular settlement.\r\nKeyword: Vernacular, Architecture, Resilience, Sustainable, and Lampung",
