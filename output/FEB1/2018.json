      "abstract": "Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the perception of civil servants within the University of Lampung's state universities on the remuneration system seen from the aspects of transparency, fairness, control, and proportionality that tested its effect on motivation, and performance. This research uses SEM-PLS data analysis method, convenient sampling method,  and 153 lecturers and 146 employees as the respondents. The results of the study show that transparency influences the work motivation, but for employees the transparency does not affect their motivation. Other results of proportionality for employees affect motivation, but for lecturers the proportionality does not affect their motivation. While fairness and control affect motivation, and motivation affects performance.",
