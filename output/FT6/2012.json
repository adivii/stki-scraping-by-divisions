      "abstract": "Since distomers of racemic drugs are frequently not used to heal diseases, utilization of single enantiomeric drugs not only decreases the drugs dosages and side effects but also reduces eco-toxicological problem.  Since enzymatic membrane reactors (EMR) can be run continuously, observation on free-enzyme catalysis as a preliminary study before development of the EMR is needed.  This paper describes acetylation of the racemic atenolol enzymatically using free lipases.  The atenolol enantiomers reacted with vinyl acetate in water miscible organic compounds and phosphate buffer solutions.  High conversions were obtained once the reactions were conducted in the organic media using PFL (XR: 84.22%, XS: 91.78%), Lipoprotein 62336 (XR: 100%; XS: 100%) and CALB (XR: 77%, XS: 51.82%).  Reactions in PO4 buffers produced low conversions.  It seems the KR process was difficult to be developed through the acetylation pathway.  During observations on the AT enantiomers’ concentrations, the analytical protocols produced excellent selectivities.  The highest selectivity was given by the slowest flow rate, which developed higher enantiomeric peak areas.",

Selection of chiral LC column and analytical protocol that fulfill demands of\r\nthe ultra fast LC analysis is essential. This article describes the characteristics of atenolol chromatographic\r\nseparation that resulted fromdifferent resolution media and analytical protocols with the use\r\nof a ChiralcelW OD column. The chromatograms showed quite different characteristics of the\r\nseparation process. The single enantiomer and racemic atenolol could be recognized by the\r\nChiralcelW OD column in less than 20 min. Symmetrical peaks were obtained; however, several\r\nprotocols produced peaks with wide bases and slanted baselines. Observations showed that efficient\r\nenantioresolution of racemic atenolol was obtained at slow mobile phase flow rate, decreased concentration\r\nof amine-type modifier but increased alcohol content in mobile phase and highest ultraviolet\r\ndetection wavelength were required. The optimal ultra fast LC protocol enables to reduce and eliminate\r\nthe peaks of either the atenolol solvent or the buffers and provided the highest peak intensities\r\nof both atenolol enantiomers.",

The water uptake and mass loss for polylactide\/wood flour composites were similar to that\r\nof plain PLA. Pyrolysis-GC-MS, however, showed that on prolonged aging the hydrolysis of PLA led to\r\nincreased wood flour concentration in the remaining biocomposite matrices. In contrast, the polylactide\/\r\nrice bran composites exhibited larger water uptake and higher mass loss. Pyrolysis-GC-MS and FTIR\r\nanalysis proved that the higher mass loss was caused by migration of rice bran from the composites. The\r\ntype of natural filler could thus greatly influence the degradation process and\/or the stability of the\r\nmaterials in aqueous or humid environments."

The additives\r\nincluded plasticizers (glycerol, sorbitol, and citric acid), inorganic fillers (halloysite and kaolin), and agrowaste-based fillers (milled\r\nwood flour and rice bran). In addition, new biobased additives were prepared from wood flour and rice bran through liquefaction\r\nreaction. Through different additive combinations, starch-based materials with significant differences in tensile properties were\r\ndesigned. Addition of halloysite nanoclay resulted in materials with improved tensile strength at break and rather low strain at\r\nbreak. The effect of kaolin on tensile strength was highly dependent on the used plasticizer. However, in most combinations the\r\naddition of kaolin resulted in materials with intermediate tensile strength and strain at break values. The addition of milled wood\r\nflour and rice bran improved the tensile strength, while the addition of liquefied fillers especially liquefied rice bran increased the\r\nstrain at break indicating that liquefied rice bran could have potential as a plasticizer for starch blends.",

Nickel incorporated MCF catalysts were prepared using deposition-precipitation at 90 oC and followed by reduction process at 550 oC. The influence of different pore topology of MCF on characteristics of the nickel incorporated MCF catalysts was studied using nitrogen physisorption, TEM, and SEM-EDX techniques. Activities of the catalysts were tested for decarboxylation of palmitic acid in solvent free condition at reaction temperature of 300 oC under nitrogen flow for production of n-pentadecane hydrocarbon fuel. The results show that NiMCF-9.2T(R) catalyst using MCF-9.2T support prepared at TEOS amount of 9.2 ml achieved the highest palmitic acid conversion and n-pentadecane yield. The highest activity was mainly attributed to the high nickel composition and a fine nickel particle dispersed in the NiMCF-9.2T(R) catalyst.",

      "abstract": "Bioetanol merupakan sumber energi alternatif yang mempunyai prospek yang baik sebagai pengganti bahan bakar minyak (BBM) dan gasohol dengan bahan baku yang dapat diperbaharui dan ramah lingkungan. Bahan baku yang digunakan dapat berasal dari biomassa yang mengandung karbohidrat dan gula. Kadar glukosa pada sampel limbah cair pengepresan kulit nenas pada industri pengalengan nenas PT. Great Giant Pieaple Co (PT.GGPC) memiliki kandungan glukosa sebsar 16,8 dengan kata lain sampel tersebut cukup layak untuk dikembangkan menjadi etanol dengan proses fermentasi. Penelitian ini mengkaji tentang fermentasi etanol dari limbah cair hasil pengepresan kulit nenas menggunakan Schizosaccharomyces pombe dengan tujuan untuk mengetahui pengaruh konsentrasi substrat dan kecepatan pengadukan terhadap temperatur optimal pada fermentasi etanol dari limbah tersebut. Proses fermentasi dilakukan secara batch anaerob dengan pengendalian pH 4,5, waktu fermentasi 4 hari, dan penambahan nutrisi pupuk urea dan NPK. Mikroorganisme yang digunakan adalah Schizosaccharomyces pombe yang memiliki daya konversi gula menjadi etanol yang tinggi. Parameter yang digunakan pada penelitian ini adalah variasi konsentrasi substrat 8, 16, 32 gr\/L dan kecepatan pengadukan 50, 150, 250 rpm. Untuk mengetahui konsumsi substrat dilakukan analisis konsentrasi glukosa dengan metode Phenol-Sulfat menggunakan alat spektrofotometer, sedangkan untuk analisis konsentrasi etanol menggunakan refraktometer, dan analisis jumlah sel mikroorganisme menggunakan alat haemacytometer. Hasil penelitian didapat konsentrasi etanol 4 g\/l - 21,22g\/l. Konsentrasi etanol tertinggi diperoleh pada temperatur 30 C, kecepatan pengadukan 0 rpm dan konsentrasi substrat 32 g\/l, yield 70,7%, laju pembentukan produk (qp) 4,07689.jam dan laju pertumbuhan spesifik maksimum 0,02199\/jam",

      "abstract": "Minyak terpentin Indonesia mengandung 65-85 % α-pinene, kurang 1% camphene, 1-3% β-pinene, 10-18 % 3-carene dan limonene 1-3%.  α-Pinene dapat dihidrasi dengan larutan asam menghasilkan  α-terpineol. Produk α-terpineol ini dapat digunakan untuk  bahan pelarut, parfum, disinfektan, dll. \r\nPenelitian ini bertujuan mempelajari parameter-parameter yang berpengaruh pada sintesis α-terpineol dari  terpentin dengan katalisator asam khloro asetat. α-Pinene (terpentin) sebanyak 0,25 mol, aquadest sebanyak 0,6 mol dan katalisator asam khloro asetat  dengan konsentrasi 6 M direaksikan dalam reaktor batch yang dilengkapi dengan pendingin balik, thermometer dan pengaduk. Parameter-parameternya adalah pengaruh suhu (60, 70, 80, 90oC), pengaruh konsentrasi katalisator asam khloro asetat (3,6,9 M), pengaruh perbandingan  mol katalisator asam khloro asetat terhadap α-pinene (0,8\/1; 1,6\/1; 2,4\/1; 3,2\/1; 4\/1) dan kecepatan pengadukan (264, 546 dan 954 rpm). \r\nDari hasil penelitian ini disarankan kondisi operasi hidrasi terpentin yang paling baik adalah  dicapai pada suhu 80oC, konsentrasi katalisator asam khloro asetat  6 M, perbandingan  mol katalisator asam khloro asetat terhadap α-pinene 2,4\/1, pengadukan dijalankan pada kecepatan  546 rpm, dan  waktu reaksi 240 menit. Konversi hidrasi terpentin menjadi α-terpineol yang diperoleh adalah 54,13%.",
