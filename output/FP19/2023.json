The study was arranged in a\r\ncompletely randomized design (CRD) with a single factor and four replications. The single factor treatment\r\nwas a stabilizer type with 6 levels, that is 0.5% CMC (P1), 0.5% sodium alginate (P2), 0.5% carrageenan\r\n(P3), 0.5% arabic gum (P4), 0.5% gelatin  (P5), and 0.5% pectin (P6). The results showed that the use of\r\nvarious types of stabilizers for ice cream with the addition of yellow sweet potato had a significant effect on\r\noverrun, texture, color, and overall acceptance, but did not significantly affect the melting speed and stability\r\nof the ice cream emulsion. The best type of stabilizer for ice cream with the addition of yellow sweet potato is\r\n0.5% gelatin (P5) with an overrun value (52.95%), emulsion stability (86.82%), melting speed (27.00\r\nminutes), texture score 4.31 (soft), color score 2.73 (yellowish white), and overall acceptance score 4.44\r\n(like). Yellow sweet potato ice cream with the addition of 0.5% gelatin stabilizer contains fat content\r\n(22.18%), protein content (6.29%), total solids content (37.36%), crude fiber content (0.67% ), and\r\nantioxidant activity (752.32 g\/mL).\r\n\r\nKeywords : ice cream, stabilizer, yellow sweet potatoes",

Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the effect of the comparison of beluntas leaf and seaweed (Eucheuma cottonii) on the sensory and physical properties of vegetable leather, and get the best comparison to produce vegetable leather as expected.  This study was arranged in a Complete Randomized Block Design (CRBD)  non factorial with four replications.

Homogeneity and additivity of the data were analyzed using Bartlett and Tuckey tests.  Then they were analyzed using variance to determine the effect between treatments.  If there is a significant effect, the data then werefurther analyzed by the Least Significant Difference Test (LSD) at the level of 5%. The results showed that the best vegetable leather were K1 treatment (30% beluntas leaf : 70% seaweed (E. cottonii)).

These waste products contain important components such as protein, minerals, and amino acids. This study aims to determine the chemical properties of liquid broth extracted from freshwater and marine shrimp shells, including ash, protein, fat, monosodium glutamate (MSG), and antioxidant. The liquid broth was extracted by boiling shrimp shells and heads in water with a ratio of 1:2 for 1 hour at 80oC. Results indicate that the type of shrimp used did not affect the broth's ash, fat, protein, MSG, or antioxidant content. Marine and freshwater shrimp liquid broths contain 0.56% and 0.28% ash, 0.10% and 0.50% fat, 2.19% and 1.97% protein, 1.5291% and 1.6274% MSG, and 2263.73 ppm and 2786.2 ppm antioxidant.",

      "abstract": "Black liquor is obtained as a by-product of the pulping process, which is used to convert biomass into pulp by removing lignin, hemicelluloses and other extractives from wood to free cellulose fibers. Lignin represents a major constituent in black liquor, with quantities varying from 20% to 30%, of which a very low share is used for manufacturing value-added products, while the rest is mainly burned for energy purposes, thus underestimating its great potential as a raw material. Therefore, it is essential to establish new isolation and extraction methods to increase lignin valorization in the development of bio-based chemicals. The aim of this research work was to determine the effect of KOH or ethanol concentration as an isolation agent on lignin yields and the chemical characteristics of lignin isolated from formacell black liquor of oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB). Isolation of lignin was carried out using KOH with various concentrations ranging from 5% to 15% (w\/v). Ethanol was also used to precipitate lignin from black liquor at concentrations varying from 5% to 30% (v\/v). The results obtained showed that the addition of KOH solution at 12.5% and 15% concentrations resulted in better lignin yield and chemical properties of lignin, i.e., pH values of 3.86 and 4.27, lignin yield of 12.78% and 14.95%, methoxyl content of 11.33% and 10.13%, and lignin equivalent weights of 476.25 and 427.03, respectively. Due to its phenolic structure and rich functional groups that are favorable for modifications, lignin has the potential to be used as a green additive in the development of advanced biocomposite products in various applications to replace current fossil fuel-based material, ranging from fillers, fire retardants, formaldehyde scavengers, carbon fibers, aerogels, and wood adhesives.",

      "abstract": "Black liquor is obtained as a by-product of the pulping process, which is used to convert biomass into pulp by\r\nremoving lignin, hemicelluloses and other extractives from wood to free cellulose fibers. Lignin represents a major\r\nconstituent in black liquor, with quantities varying from 20% to 30%, of which a very low share is used for man-\r\nufacturing value-added products, while the rest is mainly burned for energy purposes, thus underestimating its\r\ngreat potential as a raw material. Therefore, it is essential to establish new isolation and extraction methods to\r\nincrease lignin valorization in the development of bio-based chemicals. The aim of this research work was to\r\ndetermine the effect of KOH or ethanol concentration as an isolation agent on lignin yields and the chemical\r\ncharacteristics of lignin isolated from formacell black liquor of oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB). Isolation\r\nof lignin was carried out using KOH with various concentrations ranging from 5% to 15% (w\/v). Ethanol was\r\nalso used to precipitate lignin from black liquor at concentrations varying from 5% to 30% (v\/v). The results\r\nobtained showed that the addition of KOH solution at 12.5% and 15% concentrations resulted in better lignin\r\nyield and chemical properties of lignin, i.e., pH values of 3.86 and 4.27, lignin yield of 12.78% and 14.95%, meth-\r\noxyl content of 11.33% and 10.13%, and lignin equivalent weights of 476.25 and 427.03, respectively. Due to its\r\nphenolic structure and rich functional groups that are favorable for modifications, lignin has the potential to be\r\nused as a green additive in the development of advanced biocomposite products in various applications to replace\r\ncurrent fossil fuel-based material, ranging from fillers, fire retardants, formaldehyde scavengers, carbon fibers,\r\naerogels, and wood adhesives.",

This study aims to determine the chemical, microbiological, and sensory properties of the joruk during fermentation, as well as to get the right fermentation time for joruk production. Research was performed by preparing joruk using wader fish. Observations included pH, total lactic acid, water content, and total volatile base (TVB), total molds and yeasts, total microbes, and total lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Furthermore, the best treatment was observed for sensory properties and protein content. Results showed that during fermentation there was a decrease in the pH value, total mold, total microbes, and water content, while the total amount of lactic acid, LAB, and TVB increased. The best treatment was obtained on joruk stored on the 10th day of fermentation with a pH value of 6.33, total lactic acid 9.48%, water content 67.74%, TVB 93.88%, and total LAB, total mold\/yeast, and total microbes was respectively 10.46, 7.21, and 12,13 log CFU\/g. Sensory properties for raw joruk was brown with 6.2 scale, fishy (6.4), and intact appearance (5.1). Sensory properties for cooked joruk was brown (4.2), fishy (6.7), salty taste (3.1), sour taste (8.4), and incomplete appearance (2.8).  \r\nChemical",

Tempe gembus is a type of tempe which is made by fermenting tofu dregs with Rhizopus oligosporus. Tempe gembus has lower nutritional value than soybean tempe. Adding Saccharomyces cerevisiae to manufacture tempe gembus is expected to increase the added value of tempe gembus. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of various types of inoculums on the chemical properties and β-glucan content of tempe gembus. The study used a completely\r\nrandomized block design (RBD) with 3 repetitions and 7 types of inoculums: commercial tempe inoculum (RAPRIMA) (T1), S. \r\ncerevisiae (T2), R. oligosporus (T3), commercial tempe inoculum (RAPRIMA) + commercial yeast (Fermipan) (T4), commercial tempe inoculum (RAPRIMA) + S. cerevisiae (T5), R. oligosporus + Fermipan (T6), and R. oligosporus + S. cerevisiae (T7). Tempe gembus produced was analyzed for the content of fat, protein, ash, water, carbohydrates, and β-glucan. The data obtained was analyzed statistically using one way ANOVA and the Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test. The results showed that the type of tempe inoculum increased the levels of protein, ash, water and β-glucan but decreased the levels of fat and carbohydrates in tempe gembus. A mixture of R. oligosporus and S. cerevisiae produced the best tempe gembus containing 0.69% β-glucan, 6.98% protein, 0.48% ash, 83.98% water, 8.12% carbohydrates and 0.47% fat.",

Tempe gembus is a type of tempe which is made by fermenting tofu dregs with Rhizopus oligosporus. Tempe gembus has lower nutritional value than soybean tempe. Adding Saccharomyces cerevisiae to manufacture tempe gembus is expected to increase the added value of tempe gembus. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of various types of inoculums on the chemical properties and β-glucan content of tempe gembus. The study used a completely randomized block design (RBD) with 3 repetitions and 7 types of inoculums: commercial tempe inoculum (RAPRIMA) (T1), S. cerevisiae (T2), R. oligosporus (T3), commercial tempe inoculum (RAPRIMA) + commercial yeast (Fermipan) (T4), commercial tempe inoculum (RAPRIMA) + S. cerevisiae (T5), R. oligosporus + Fermipan (T6), and R. oligosporus + S. cerevisiae (T7). Tempe gembus produced was analyzed for the content of fat, protein, ash, water, carbohydrates, and β-glucan. The data obtained was analyzed statistically using one way ANOVA and the Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test. The results showed that the type of tempe inoculum increased the levels of protein, ash, water and β-glucan but decreased the levels of fat and carbohydrates in tempe gembus. A mixture of R. oligosporus and S. cerevisiae produced the best tempe gembus containing 0.69% β-glucan, 6.98% protein, 0.48% ash, 83.98% water, 8.12% carbohydrates and 0.47% fat.",

      "abstract": "Premium tempeh starter is a tempeh starter containing a mixed inoculum of Rhizopus oligosporus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previously, premium tempeh starter was made in the form of liquid culture. This study aims to produce premium tempeh starter in powder form with the best type of substrate and incubation time so that it can be used practically. In this study, the effect of substrate type and incubation time on microbial viability of instant premium tempeh starter was studied. The study was arranged in a Completely Randomized Block Design with two factors and three replications. The first factor was the type of substrate: tapioca flour and rice flour, while the second factor was the incubation time at room temperature: 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours. The instant premium tempeh starter was analyzed for pH value, water content, number of fungi, yeast and bacteria. The microbial viability of tempeh starter was indicated by the growth of fungi, yeast and bacteria during incubation. The data obtained were analyzed by analysis of variance and further tested with the Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test at a 5% significance level. The results showed that rice flour and incubation time of 96 hours produced the best premium tempeh instant starter with the number of fungi of 9.02 Log CFU\/g, 9.17 Log CFU\/g yeast, 7.81 Log CFU\/g bacteria, pH 4.2 and 7.75% water content. Tempeh made using the best premium tempeh instant starter has a chemical composition in accordance with the tempeh product standard (SNI 3144:2015).",

The research was arranged in a Completely Randomized Block Design (RAKL) with a single factor consisting of 9 levels and 3 repetitions. Formulation of palm starch and SPI in making chicken sausage, namely A0 (33% tapioca as control), A1 (5%.10 %), A2 (5 % 13 %), A3 (10% 10%), A4 (10% 13%), A5 (15%:10%), A6 (15% 13%), A7 (20% 10%), and A8 (20% 13 %).  The homogeneity of the data was tested by the Bartlett test and the addition of the data by the Tuckey test. The data were analyzed by variance to determine the effect between treatments, if there was a significant effect, the data were further analyzed with the Least Significant Difference (BNT) test at 5% level. The results showed that the addition of the formulation of the ratio of palm starch and SPI significantly affected the sensor properties of texture, taste, aroma, appearance and overall acceptance as well as physical properties (texture), WHC, and cooking loss. The comparison formulation of palm starch and SPI that produces the best chicken sausage is treatment A3 (palm starch 5% SPI 10%) which has a texture score of 7.13 (solid and compact, taste and aroma score of 7.09 (typical of chicken sausage), appearance of 7 .15 (less brilliant), and overall acceptance 7.69 (like), as well as the physical properties of texture 180.25 gf, WHC 45.57%, and cooking loss 21.29% The best treatment resulted in a moisture content of 63.61%, 2,31% ash content, 20.50% protein content, and 3.52% fat content which have met SNI No. 3820.2015.\r\n\r\nKeywords: chicken sausage, palm starch, soy protein isolat (SPI)",

      "abstract": "A wide range of cassava derivative products,\r\nsuch as starch and flour, was applied in various food\r\nproducts. Therefore, this research investigated the\r\nprocessing techniques of cassava starch and flour, each\r\nwith the aim of extracting the superior properties and\r\ncharacteristics for a specific end product. By modifying the\r\nexisting procedures with integrated cassava processing\r\ntechnology, the production of both products could occur\r\nsimultaneously. This was renewal processing as unified\r\ntechnology, which implied that one single processing could\r\ngenerate two products at a time. In addition to producing a \r\nsuperior characteristic, the integrated method also saved\r\ntime and cost. In this research, two factors of Completely\r\nRandomized Design (CRD) were used in three replications.\r\nThe first factor was soaking in the flowing\r\nwater\/continuous system (P1) and static water\/batch\r\nsystem (P2). The second was the fermentation time (T) of\r\n24 hours (T1), 48 hours (T2), and 72 hours (T3).\r\nFurthermore, the steps conducted include weighing, brown\r\nand white skin peeling, washing, size reduction, immersion\r\nin continuous and batch systems, fermentation for 24, 48,\r\nand 72 hours, refining\/milling, and starch extraction,\r\nfollowed by the pressing process. The existing slurry was\r\ndeposited for 8 hours, then the starch was extracted. The \r\nstarch and flour were dried in the oven at 60o\r\nC until\r\nreaching a maximum moisture content of 13%. They were\r\nmilled and sifted in a 100-mesh sieve. The results showed\r\nthat the spontaneous fermentation process in the integrated\r\ncassava technology produces the superior characteristics of\r\nmodified cassava starch and flour to the point of being\r\nrecommended as a model. The yield whiteness value, and\r\nswelling power (g\/g) of modified cassava starch and flour\r\nrange from 9.0-12.5% and 30.58-35.44%, 91.34-94.04, and\r\n90.41-91.56, as well as 13.28-14.35 and 14.43-17.44 (w\/w),\r\nrespectively. The amylograph characteristics of the starch\r\npaste included longer fermentation, increasing pasting\r\ntemperature, increasing maximum viscosity (value > 600),\r\ndecreasing breakdown, and increasing setback value.\r\nMeanwhile, for flour paste, it includes longer fermentation,\r\nincreasing pasting temperature, decreasing peak viscosity\r\n(value > 500), decreasing breakdown, and increasing\r\nsetback value",

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mempelajari pengaruh penambahan TBD sebagai bahan penstabil terhadap sifat fisik dan sensori es krim susu kambing. Penelitian dilakukan dengan Rancangan Acak Kelompok Lengkap (RAKL) faktor faktor dalam 5 ulangan yaitu 5 taraf persentase TBD 0% (F1), 1,5% (F2),  3% (F3), 4,5% (F4) , 6% (F5), menggunakan gelatin (0,5%) sebagai kontrol. Data yang diperoleh kesamaan ragamnya diuji menggunakan uji Bartlett. Data dianalisis dengan ANOVA dan HSD 5% untuk membandingkan perbedaan pada semua perlakuan. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa penggunaan berbagai konsentrasi TBD berpengaruh terhadap overrun, kecepatan leleh, stabilitas emulsi, warna, tekstur, dan penerimaan es krim susu kambing secara keseluruhan. Karakteristik es krim etawa terbaik dihasilkan pada penambahan tepung biji 3% dengan tekstur lembut, warna putih kekuningan, nilai overrun 33,40%, kecepatan leleh 25 menit, stabilitas emulsi 83%, serta nilai gizi lemak, protein dan total padatan sesuai persyaratan SNI No 01-3713-2018.",

      "abstract": "Fermentation treatments change the pasting properties of sweet potato flour, which may \r\nimprove its utilization in composite flour. This research was carried out to evaluate the \r\npasting properties of composite fermented sweet potato flour and the quality of composite \r\nsalted noodles using those composite flour. Sweet potato slices were fermented using five \r\ndifferent starters (spontaneous, Lactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, a \r\nmix of Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and a mix of\r\nLactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), \r\nand processed into flour. Native sweet potato flour without fermentation was also \r\nprepared as a control. A total of six sweet potato flour (SPF) were then used to substitute \r\n50% of the wheat flour in composite white salted noodles. Then, the pasting properties of \r\nthe composite flour and the quality of the noodles were evaluated. Results proved that \r\ncomposite fermented SPF had higher pasting properties (peak and final viscosity, break \r\ndown, and set back value) than those of composite non-fermented SPF. The substitution \r\nfor fermented SPF in composite white salted noodles decreased cooking loss, cooking \r\ntime, solid loss, soluble loss, swelling index, adhesiveness, and water absorption, while \r\ncohesiveness, elasticity, elongation, and colour brightness increased significantly. \r\nTherefore, the incorporation of fermented SPF enhanced the quality of composite white \r\nsalted noodles.",
