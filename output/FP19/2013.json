      "abstract": "This research was conducted to find out the effect of \r\ngelatin concentration on the sensory characteristic of goat milk jelly candy.  The research was designed using a Completely Randomized Block Design with gelatin concentration as a single factor consisting of five levels, namely 5%, 10%, 15%,20%, and 25%. The research was repeated 5 times.   Data were analyzed with Analysis of Varians to find out the treatment effects, then continued tested using Least Significant Difference (LSD) test to find out the best treatment which was determined by the highest score of flavor, elasticity, color, and overall acceptance. Chemical composition analysis was conducted on the best treatment product. The result showed that gelatin concentration had significant effect on flavor and highly significant effect on elasticity, color, and overall acceptance of the goat milk jelly candy.  The best treatment was gelatin addition at a concentration of 10%.  The candy had a flavor score of 3.35 (rather typical of goat milk), an elasticity score of 3.55 (elastic), and hedonic score for color of 3.66 (like) and an overall acceptance of 3.73 (like). Its water, ash,\r\nreduced sugar, protein, and fat contents were 18.01%, 1.60%,\r\n13.56%, 5.65%, and 0.21%, respectively. \r\nKeywords: gelatin, goat milk, jelly candy",

      "abstract": "The purposes of this research are to analyze the financial feasibility of nutmeg farming and the feasibility of \r\nits cultivation aspects, technical aspects, and market aspects. This research uses a census method.\r\nFeasibility analysis is calculated by the ratio of revenue to cost (B\/C), Payback Period (PP), Net Present\r\nValue (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), sensitivity analysis, and analysis the feasibility of cultivation\r\naspects, technical aspects, and market aspects.  The results showed that at 15% of interest rate, the 25 years\r\nlong of intensive cultivation of nutmeg farming in Gisting of Tanggamus Regency deserved Net B\/C Ratio\r\n2.23; NPV of Rp125,574,036; IRR 20.98% and PP 10.01.  The effect of changes with the likely costsrose by\r\n10%, decreased the production by 25%, or it  decreased the output prices by 10%, but the farm was still in\r\nthe state of intensive nutmeg feasible and profitable.  On the cultivation aspects, the climate and rain fall in\r\nthe district of Gisting Tanggamus was appropriated to nutmeg plants; on the technical aspects, the majority\r\nof farmers still used traditional technology, particularly in post harvest technology such as processing of\r\nnutmeg became essential oils or a variety of snacks. In fact, on the aspects of the market of nutmeg was very\r\ngood, in which the demand side was greater than the supply side so that the market opportunity for this\r\nproduct was still very promising.\r\n\r\nKeywords : B\/C, IRR, NPV, PP, nutmeg",

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk\r\nmengetahui peranan enzim ektraseluler S. cereviciae dalam pembuatan tapioka dengan mengamati perubahan biokimia\r\npati. Sebanyak 1010 sel ml-1 inokulum S.cerevisiae diinokulasikan ke dalam suspensi tapioka, kemudian difermentasi\r\nselama 12 jam, 36 jam, dan 48 jam pada suhu ruang (30o\r\nC). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa S.cerevisiae mampu\r\ntumbuh selama fermentasi dan memperbaiki sifat biokimia tapioka. Tapioka hasil fermentasi dengan S.cerevisiae\r\nmemiliki kadar protein (2,17%) secara signifikan lebih tinggi dari kadar protein tapioka alami (0,28%). Sementara\r\nitu, kadar amilosa tapioka terfermentasi (24,83%) lebih rendah dari amilosa tapioka alami (28,57%). Dilain pihak,\r\npenambahan S.cerevsiae meningkatkan kadar Fe, Mg, dan Ca tapioka, tetapi kadar Zn nya menurun. Struktur granula\r\npati tapioka terfermentasi juga menunjukkan adanya erosi di bagian tepi granula. Penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa\r\npenambahan S.cerevisiae dapat digunakan sebagai agensia modifikasi tapioka untuk meningkatkan kadar protein dan\r\ndaya kelarutan."

Therefore , a frying process at low temperature and low pressureis needed. The objective of this research was to determine the best CaCl2 concentration, soaking time, and the interaction between  them in producing the best muli banana cracker using vacuum frying. The factorial experiment was arranged  in a complete randomized block design with three replications. The first factor was the CaCl2 (K) concentration and the second factor was soaking time (T). The CaCl2 concentration consisted of three levels: 1% (K1), 2% (K2), and 3% (K3). The soaking times were 10 minutes (T1), 20 minutes (T2), and 30 minutes (T3). Weight of each sample processed was 2 kg. The sensory evaluation data homogeneity  and additivity were  tested using Bartlet  and Tuckey tests.  Then the data were analyzed using ANOVA, and further analyzed using honest significant difference with significant level of 5%. The best organoleptic properties of vacuum fried muli banana cracker was found on the treatment of  1% CaCl2 soaked for10 minutes (K1L1) with characteristics of typical banana aroma, yellow brownish color, sweet and a little bit sour taste, no after taste, and crunchy. The overall acceptance was favorable.\r\n\r\nKeywords: CaCl2, cracker, crunchiness, muli banana, vacuum frying",

      "abstract": "Starch residue samples from two Australian sweet potato varieties (Beauregard and Northern Star) and two Indonesian sweet potato varieties (Bis192 and Bis183), and a commercial sample of sweet potato starch residue, were studied for their pectins. Pectins were extracted using 0.1M HCl, 0.05M NaOH, 0.1M HCl\/0.75% SHMP and 0.05M NaOH\/0.75% SHMP. Hydrolysis of residual starch in the cell wall of sweet potato using heat stable -amylase and amyloglucosidase was employed prior to pectin extraction to eliminate starch contamination. Pectins were characterised for yield, galacturonic acid content (GA), and the degree of esterification (DE). Conventionally, pectin is characterized by titration, photometry and HPLC. However these methods are cumbersome and time consuming.  On the other hand, 13C CP\/MAS solid-state NMR, a non-destructive, efficient and direct method, has been found to be well-suited for these purposes since pectin has well-defined 13C NMR spectra. Therefore 13C CP\/MAS solid state NMR was used for pectin determination. The pectin characteristics are dependent on variety and extraction process; however, the extraction methods gave variable results. Yields were between 7 and 30% of the cell wall. GA varied from 27 to 80% with the highest found in Bis192 extracted using NaOH\/SHMP. DE varied between traceable and 57%. HCl extraction gave higher DE, while NaOH\/SHMP caused demethylation. Overall, this study demonstrated that pectin from sweet potato starch residue is mainly low in methoxyl groups.",

      "abstract": "Fermented milk products are widely consumed for their positive health image, which can be further enhanced\r\nby the addition of probiotic bacteria with therapeutic properties. One of the fermented milk products is\r\nfermented turi-milk; however, the turi milk has unpleasant off flavor and sour taste. The objective of this study\r\nwas to determine the best treatment in producing fermented turi-milks with acceptable flavor and taste. Two\r\ntreatments were arranged in Randomized Block Design with 3 replications. The first treatment was sugar types\r\nwhich consisted of sucrose, glucose, and a sucrose-glucose mixture at a ratio of 1:1. The second treatment was\r\nconcentrations of sugar consisting of 29.25%, 35.75%, 42.25%, and 48.75% (w\/v). Clean turi seeds were\r\nsubmerged in 0.5% NaHCO3 solution at 80oC for 15 minutes, crushed using a blender, and filtered with filter\r\ncloth to obtain turi milk. The turi milk was added with 10% skim milk powder and 4% glucose, inoculated with\r\nLactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus, and then incubated at 37oC for 96 hours to produce fermented turi-milks.\r\nThe fermented turi-milks were added with sugar at different concentrations and then stored at refrigerate\r\ntemperature for 12 days. After storing for 12 days, samples of the turi-milks were taken, and analyzed to\r\ndetermine their pH, total acid bacteria, and sensory characteristics. Result of this study showed that adding\r\nsucrose at a concentration of 35.75% (w\/v) was the best treatment to produce fermented turi-milk with\r\nacceptable flavor and taste. The best fermented turi-milk had a pH of 3.71, a total lactic acid bacteria of 3.62 x\r\n1011 cfu\/g, a taste scores of 3.75, a flavor score of 3.3, and an overall acceptance score of 3.75 (out of 5 scales).",

      "abstract": "Characteristics of cincau extract  sinbiotic beverage  were influenced by the addition ofruit juice and glucose concentrations. In this research, the addition of pineapple juice and glucose were studied to determine the best  characteristics of cincau extractsinbiotic beverage. The experiment used two treatment factors , namely the concentration of pineapple juice which consists of 5 levels ie 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% and the concentration of glucose which consists of 3 levels ie 2%, 3%, and 4%. Observations included the analysis of total lactic acid bacteria, total lactic acid pH, and antioxidant activity. The results of further analysis of the data presented descriptively. The results showed that increasing concentrations of glucose andpineapple juice can increase the total lactic acid bacteria, lowering the pH value, and increase the total lactic acid cincau extract sinbiotic beverage. The antioxidant activityof  cincau extract  sinbiotic beverage  given the addition of pineapple juice reaches 60-70%. The concentration of glucose and pineapple juice is relatively no differencesignificant antioxidant activity.\r\n\r\nKeywords : cincau, pineapple fruit, sinbiotic beverage",
