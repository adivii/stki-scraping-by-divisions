A total of 156 Saburai goat breeders in two districts were selected as respondents by using stratified random sampling method. Based on descriptive statistical analysis illustrated that goat breeders in Tanggamus district been categorized potential breeder (moderate) Saburai goat breeders have implemented efficiently (R\/C = 1,28). Business efficiency as an indicator of the competitiveness of micro-scale goat farming is closely related to the resource potential breeders. Improved resource potential breeders can be achieved by increasing the supply of production inputs, labor productivity and a wide range of technology introduction farm \/ ranch.",

The success\r\nof business development of farm animal cannot be separated from the inluence of genetic and\r\nenvironmental factors. One effort that can be taken to improve the genetic quality of the goat\r\nis through crossbreeding. Crossbreeding is one of good way to improve animal production.\r\nCrossbreeding between female Ettawah grade goats and male boer goats are known with the name\r\nBoerawa goat. Currently Boerawa goat are developed in Tanggamus District Lampung Province.\r\nThe results of crossbreeding are expected to have higher performance than Ettawah grade goat.\r\nHigh performance of growth is the result of genetic inheritance of Boer goats that have superior\r\ngrowth characteristics. This research was conducted using survey method in Gisting, Tanggamus\r\nDistrict Lampung Province. Qualitative data on the morphological characteristics and performance\r\nin a descriptive analysis from observations indicate that the morphological characteristics of goats\r\ncrossing at the post weaning period is better. It can be seen from some morphological parameters\r\nthat were observed, among others; body length, shoulder height, chest circumference, and of\r\naspects of performance; litter size, birth weight, and ADG also showed signiicant improvement\r\nin this Boerawa goat",

Data consisted of 3,920 singles and 4,492 twins birth type and they were the progeny of 285 sires and 5,279 dams. We found a significant sire by BT interaction with the sire x BT effect accounting for 1.59% and 2.49% of the phenotypic variation for birth weight (BWT) and weaning weight (WWT), respectively. The effect was not significant for post weaning weight (PWWT), scan fat (SF) and eye muscle depth (EMD) with sire x BT effects accounting for less than 1% of the variation. Sire by RT interaction effects were much smaller and not significant for WWT, PWWT and SF, but accounting for 1,83% in EMD, which was significant. Results from bivariate analysis correlations lower than one for expression of weight traits when expressed in singles versus twins, with BT having a slightly larger effect on genotype expression than RT.",

This study was conducted in April 2014 to 1,410 head of beef cattle belonging to 776 farmers. The research used a survey method with primary and secondary data. Analysis data used regression analysis with SPSS ( Statistic Packet for Social Science) program.The results showed that the conception rate in the district Jati Agung is a great identity for 36.03 ± 1.16. Factors that effect conception rates in beef cattle in the district Jati Agung is distance between the cowshed with house that negatively assosiated with factor value 0.003, number of factor concentrate that negatively assosiated with factor value of 0.027, amount of forage factor that negatively assosiated with factor value 0.003, a large area of the cage that negatively assosiated with factor value 0.020, and amount of beef cows that maintained that negatively assosiated with factor value 0.049 and a positive association was never followed a course that positively assosiated with factor value 0.112. The factors that influence conception rates in beef cattle farm level is great on long weaning period that negatively assosiated with factor value 0.013, mating postpartum that positiively assosiated with factor value 0.376, calving interval that negatively assosiated with factor value 0.412, the age of cattle that positively assosiated with factor value 0.006, the first estrus postpartum artificial insemination that positively assosiated with factor value 0.133 and time to insemination that negatively assosiated with factor value 0,406.\r\n(Key words: Conception rate, Beef cows, The factors and value)",

The research was conducted on 20th of December 2014 until 19th of January 2015 in Varia Agung Jaya village, Seputih Mataram subdistrict, Lampung Tengah.  The fabrication of probiotic from local mikrobial at 8th until 19th December 2014 in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Lampung University. This experiment arranged a completely randomized design (CRD) with 4 probiotic levels of local microbes (0%, 1%, 2%, and 3%) and 5 replications. The data obtained were analyzed using Analysis of Variance at 1% and continued with Polynom Orthogonal test at 1%. The result of this research showed that the additional of probiotic from local microbial (0%, 1%, 2%, and 3%) was not significant effect (P>0,05) to the number of erythrocytes of layer, but highly significant effect (P <0,01) to the number of hemoglobin. Probiotic levels of local microbial (0%, 1%, 2%, and 3%) can increase the number of hemoglobin with regression equality (Ŷ = 6,68 + 0,48X).\r\n\r\n(Keywords : Layer, Probiotics from local microbial,The number of erythrocytes and Hemoglobin)",
