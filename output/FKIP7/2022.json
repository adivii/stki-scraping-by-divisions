One of the components developed in the element of education is the curriculum. The curriculum is a reference for the implementation of the teaching and learning process in all educational units for all subjects. Lampung language is one of the regional languages in Indonesia and has been taught by the local government of Lampung Province since 1975. The focus of teaching the Lampung language is on linguistic elements in which there is literacy, culture, and literature. The development of the learning paradigm that is attached to each curriculum becomes a reference that every educator needs to study so that the learning mission can be achieved optimally. The research method used in this research is descriptive qualitative. The purpose of qualitative description descriptive is research that is used to examine natural objects to describe, describe, explain, explain, and answer in more detail the problems to be studied. For the Lampung language subject, the implementation has elements of specific learning and teaching principles. It consists of, the context of language learning, language skills, strategies to grow language acquisition, and language skills. So whatever the curriculum development and learning paradigm, Lampung language learning still puts forward the four principles of language learning and teaching.",

Therefore, academic and practical efforts should be made to contribute to the local language maintenance and one of the possible solutions is through technology. The aim of the present study was to develop an Android-based bilingual dictionary application for smartphones for language maintenance. This study adopted developmental research with three phases (analysis, product design and development, and product try-out and evaluation). The data was collected through instruments including literature reviews, interviews, expert judgments, and questionnaires followed by descriptive analyses. The results indicate that the development of an Android-based Lampung language dictionary application for smartphones has successfully contributed to Lampung language maintenance and preservation. The Android-based application is positively perceived as a form of minority language maintenance and preservation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) era. The study’s implications and recommendations are also discussed for future research.",

      "abstract": "The study of the Lampung script's forms and variations in ancient manuscripts is a branch of linguistics concerned with the script's evolution. We made observations on the Lampung script on two ancient manuscripts, the NLP97N69 and the Hahiwang. Both manuscripts are housed separately. The NLP97N69 manuscript was found in Indonesia, whereas the Hahiwang in Germany. A philological and paleographic approach was adopted to investigate the Lampung script's forms and variations in the ancient manuscripts. Both manuscripts were examined in conjunction with a presentation of the scriptwriter's Lampung script. After raising the Lampung script, it was compared to the current script and Van der Tuuk's script table. Discrepancies were found out between the characters in the two manuscripts, the contemporary script, and Van der Tuuk's table. Furthermore, the gha script was found out to be unique to the NLP97N69 manuscript. It was created in an attempt to meet the needs of Lampung language users who desired a unique script that incorporated the gha sound. This study demonstrates that the Lampung script has evolved and changed over time in response to its users' needs. Additionally, the article discusses the implications and future directions for research.",

      "abstract": "Piil pesenggiri is a local wisdom that becomes the life philosophy of the Lampung people and becomes the values and norms that govern the way of life of the community as social beings.  This study only focuses on 3 aspects, nemui nyimah (friendly in welcoming guests), nengah nyappur (easy to blend in with society), sakai sambayan (please help and work together).  This study aims to find out how the Lampung people apply piil pesenggiri as a philosophy of life in a multicultural society.  This study used a qualitative descriptive method, with interview data collection techniques on informants who were carried out in depth.  The results of this study indicate that piil pesenggiri can be applied to a multicultural society despite experiencing several obstacles.  1) The application of the aspect of nemui nyimah is carried out by the informant by welcoming or\r\nentertaining his friends who play at their place of residence by being friendly and polite.  2) The application of the nengah nyappur aspect is done by inviting people to chat at certain times when they meet, such as going to the mosque for Friday prayers, inviting children around their homes to play together when they have free time.  3) The application of the sakai sambayan aspect is done by helping his friends in everything that can be done both materially and non-materially.  The obstacles that the researchers found in the field were 2 factors, internal factors (lack of self-confidence from informants) and external factors (people's conditions that tended\r\nto be individualistic and closed).",
