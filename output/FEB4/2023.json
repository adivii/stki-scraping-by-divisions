      "abstract": "This study aims to examine the factors that influence the trust and interest in e-commerce transactions among\r\nMSME actors in Indonesia. Therefore, a study was conducted on the effect of these variables. Background of the problem: The transition of MSMEs in Indonesia to using e-commerce for carrying out their business transactions. Every year, there is an increase in the number of MSMEs converting from conventional to digital, as well as the government's\r\ncontribution to assist in the transition. Novelty: The variable of interest in transacting through e-commerce is the basis for conventional businesses to switch to digital, but in other studies, no one has added a variable of\r\ntrust as an intervening variable, and several other supporting variables for the interest in transacting via e-commerce. This study presents new research that provides a comprehensive view of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and how it relates to trust and interest in e-\r\ncommerce transactions. Research Methods: This study uses a snowball sampling technique by employing a survey of the MSMEs in Indonesia with certain criteria. This study also uses structural equation modeling (SEM) based on partial least squares (PLS). Findings\/Results: This study proves that all the variables of trust and interest in e-commerce\r\ntransactions are supportive and significant, but there are two hypotheses that do not support them (H3 and H6). This shows that empirically MSMEs are not necessarily interested in using e-commerce for their business transactions. Conclusion: This study provides insight into the\r\ntrust and interest in e-commerce transactions among MSME business actors. We suggest that the MSMEs should switch to using e-commerce for their transactions, to develop their businesses into digital ones.",

      "abstract": "Inseparable from managing regional fixed assets is the quality of information or data utilized by each unit. The quality of accounting information in government is heavily dependent on the leadership's commitment, the effectiveness of internal control, and the execution of good governance, according to various published works; nevertheless, this must be demonstrated further. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the link and size of the influence of these three elements on the quality of accounting information and their impact on the efficacy of local government fixed asset management. In Indonesia, 34 provincial governments, 416 district governments, and 98 city governments were surveyed for this quantitative research. This study included 529 participants. The research data was gathered using a questionnaire instrument that included in-person interviewsâ€”data analysis using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method with Lisrel 8.8 statistical software. The explanation of research findings is both descriptive and causally explanatory. In general, local governments in Indonesia have excellent accounting data and management of fixed assets. In carrying out local government tasks, the local government has also built an effective internal control system and excellent governance. The study's findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of internal control and the function of good governance substantially impact the quality of accounting data. Similarly, leadership commitment, the importance of good governance, and the accuracy of accounting information substantially impact the success of fixed asset management. However, internal control efficacy does not significantly impact managing local governments' fixed assets.",

      "abstract": "The preparation of regional budgets is influenced by many factors, so the decision-making must be careful and thorough and supported by adequate data sources. However, human resources also have limitations in storing and remembering the data needed for making budgetary decisions. The preparation of government financial statements currently uses the accrual basis, so that more and more data will be available. Information technology support can reduce the gap between the capabilities of human resources and the demands of budget decisions. This study aims to examine and analyze the effect of information technology support on the perceived usefulness of decision making and its implications for the quality of accrual-based accounting. The object of this research is the government of Lampung Province. The population used is the entire Lampung Provincial Government, while the sample used in this study is the Lampung Provincial Government SKPD. The data was obtained through the distribution of questionnaires to the respondents, namely the SKPD of the Lampung Provincial Government. The data was analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) with Lisrel software. This study uses primary data by using a questionnaire as a research instrument. The output of this research is expected to be published in Scopus indexed international journals or national journals (SINTA-4) and the results of this study are expected to be taken into consideration by the government in improving its regional financial performance and realizing financial management accountability in government in Indonesia",
