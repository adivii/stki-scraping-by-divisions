      "abstract": "Many people underestimate learning in pesantren. Muslim students are considered unable to keep up with the times because of the rigidity of the pesantren rules. Meanwhile, literacy learning and literary processing today seems to decrease with the development of modern art. The making of literary works by a writer is highly influenced by his\/her environment. Despite the rigidity of the rules as considered by the people, there are many pesantren-based writers. This study aimed to determine the imagination and creativity of literary texts produced by pesantren-based writers. Heuristic, hermeneutic, and intertextual reading methods were performed eclectically to analyze the content, values, and language styles in literary texts. Literary texts that become the focus of the study were those written by pesantren-based writers i.e. poems written by Gus Mus, Ahmad Tohari's short stories, and Habiburrahman El Shirazy's novels. This study found that the imagination and creativity of the literature written by pesantren-based writers tend to be identical with the commitment and quality of the creator's religiosity. It can be implied that the aspects of religiosity and the atmosphere of pesantren that can blow up the imagination and creativity in literary processing can be adopted to support literacy learning and literary processing by public educational institutions outside the pesantren.",

Indonesia is a country with a high level of family disorganization. The clearest evidence is the high divorce rate in Indonesia. Based on data from the Supreme Court of the Republic of Indonesia (2016), there is an average of 1008 divorce hearings every day throughout Indonesia. This reality can not only be proven by various surveys but can also be seen through the products of people's thoughts, for example in literary works. Understanding the problem of family disorganization through literary works is important to do to open up new perspectives on the issue. Moreover, family issues in Indonesia are still often considered taboo to be discussed academically.

This research was conducted to analyze the problem of family disorganization in Indonesia, which is contained in the short story Sarap by Okky Madasari.\r\nMaterials and Methods: This research was conducted with a literature study scheme and interviews based on the principles of Lucien Goldmann's genetic structuralism approach. The literature study was carried out on the\r\nshort story text of Sarap by Okky Madasari as well as social facts in various literary sources. Interviews were conducted with Okky Madasari as a writer, to explore her motives and social background in writing.  Results: It was found a description of the family disorganization type of family crisis due to internal factors. The factors behind the authors in writing are phenomena found in her daily experiences. The description of family disorganization in Sarap's short stories has a parallel structure with the social facts that exist in Indonesian society.\r\nConclusion: The study of family disorganization carried out in Okky Madasari's short story Sarap can open up new perspectives on this phenomenon, especially what occurs in Indonesia.

      "abstract": "The cultural diversity that exists in various regions in Indonesia produces a lot of potential for local wisdom and tradition. Various Indonesian local wisdom has been used as teaching material in the classroom. However, pepaccur local wisdom is still rarely known and used as teaching material.\r\nTherefore it is a novelty to turn pepaccur local wisdom into Indonesian literary teaching materials. This study aims to investigate the properness of pepaccur local wisdom for Indonesian literary teaching materials. The qualitative approach used in this study is characterized by collecting data through interviews, observation, recording and book review, and other sources related to pepaccur local\r\nwisdom. Content analyses were also used in analyzing the collected data. The results of this study are in the form of pepaccur presentations that are appropriate to be used as teaching materials for Indonesia language and literature based on the characteristics of the functions and values of local wisdom contained in them. Values contained in pepaccur such as religion, simplicity, cooperation, and politeness can be a reference in behaving in the community and this integration can be an effort to preserve local wisdom that has begun to be abandoned by the Lampung community. Implications from this study, through pepaccur-based teaching materials, students can learn to live a simple life, have a\r\ncommunity with mutual help and respect, and learn poetic arts to provide entertainment and advice",

      "abstract": "Online learning decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic have problems in its application. Besides infrastructure, teachers’ ability to integrate technology in learning is also an important factor that affects the success of online learning. In the current online learning, teachers are required to master Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK). Thus, this research aims to explore the Indonesian language teachers’ TPCK and readiness to conduct online learning during the COVID-19 outbreak. This research applied a survey method with 318 participating teachers in Lampung, Indonesia. The data were collected using questionnaires related to attitude, technological knowledge, content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, pedagogical content\r\nknowledge, technological content knowledge, technological pedagogical knowledge, and technological pedagogical content knowledge. They were then analyzed quantitatively using factor analysis and qualitatively based on the teachers’ answers to learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results demonstrate that Indonesian language teachers have adapted to the implementation of online learning related to the use of technology such as the variety of learning media and educational platforms used as well as TPCK skills. In general, teachers’ TPCK tends to be positive about online learning even though some senior teachers have a negative attitude to the technological aspects. They have difficulty using technology in learning so that the class looks monotonous and does not vary. The results of this research can be used as evaluation material by policymakers to improve the learning system.",

      "abstract": "Many people underestimate learning in pesantren. Muslim students are considered unable to keep up with the times because of the rigidity of the pesantren rules. Meanwhile, literacy learning and literary processing today seems to decrease with the development of modern art. The making of\r\nliterary works by a writer is highly influenced by his\/her environment. Despite the rigidity of the rules as considered by the people, there are many pesantren-based writers. This study aimed to determine the imagination and creativity of literary texts produced by pesantren-based writers.\r\nHeuristic, hermeneutic, and intertextual reading methods were performed eclectically to analyze the content, values, and language styles in literary texts. Literary texts that become the focus of the study were those written by pesantren-based writers i.e. poems written by Gus Mus, Ahmad Tohari's short\r\nstories, and Habiburrahman El Shirazy's novels. This study found that the imagination and creativity of the literature written by pesantren-based writers tend to be identical with the commitment and quality of the creator's religiosity. It can be implied that the aspects of religiosity and the atmosphere of pesantren that can blow up the imagination and creativity in literary processing can be adopted to support literacy learning and literary processing by public educational institutions outside the pesantren.",
