      "abstract": "Penelitian ini bertujuan mengidentifikasi dan menganalisis strategi yang digunakan siswa dalam menulis kreatif melalui pembelajaran daring, serta kendala yang dihadapi siswa Kelas VIII SMP di Kabupaten Pringsewu Tahun 2020. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode deskripstif kualitatif, berupa studi kasus. Sumber data berupa proses menulis, termasuk guru dan hasil pembelajaran. Sampel dalam penelitian ini berjumlah 29 siswa, yang ditentukan secara purposif, khususnya siswa yang memiliki kemampuan menulis dengan kategori sepuluh terbaik di sekolahnya. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan keseluruhan siswa dominan menggunakan strategi dalam menulis kreatif, yakni sebanyak 71,55% dengan kategori baik. Strategi yang dilakukan siswa terkait dengan proses penulisan (79,31%), penetapan tujuan (48,28%), pengaturan waktu (58,62%), dan pemanfaatan bahan (100%). Untuk produk tulisan ditemukan rerata nilai siswa untuk semua komponen sebesar 77,75 (83,62%) dengan kategori baik. Selama proses penulisan ditemukan beberapa kendala, yakni 6,90% siswa kurang paham dalam hal menetapkan tujuan menulis dan 16,38% siswa kurang mampu mengelola waktu karena penulisan dilakukan di rumah (terlalu leluasa)",

      "abstract": "Learning activities in the classroom will be effective if students are actively involved and enthusiastic in learning. However, effective learning cannot be implemented due to many factors, such as a lack of student motivation. A lack of motivation has been one of the most frustrating obstacles\r\nto student learning by teachers. This study identifies the effect and role of reward and punishment by teachers in improving student motivation during classroom learning. This study used an experimental method. Two eleven classes were randomly selected as the experimental class and the control\r\nclass. This experiment was carried out on Indonesian subjects in a public school in South Lampung,\r\nIndonesia. The learning motivation indicators used in the questionnaire include the desire to succeed, the motivation and need for learning, future hopes and aspirations, rewards in learning, interesting learning activities, and a conducive learning environment. Data were analyzed using the instrument test and Theta correlation coefficient test. The results showed that the implementation of reward and punishment had a positive effect on student motivation. The reward and punishment method engages students to be active in various activities, giving rewards as appreciation and punishment as a trigger not to fail, resulting in increased learning motivation. Teachers can use the findings of the current study as a reference and a way to improve student motivation for effective and meaningful learning.",

      "abstract": "Menulis merupakan kegiatan yang membutuhkan kerja sama antara\r\nseluruh indra dan pikiran untuk menghasilkan informasi yang benar. Khusus dalam menulis berita, terdapat kaidah-kaidah yang harus dipatuhi agar tulisan yang dibuat memiliki nilai berita, di antaranya, unsur 5W + 1H. Permasalahan penelitian ini adalah siswa belum mampu menulis teks berita karena kurangnya sumber belajar yang memadai. Oleh karena itu, tujuan penelitian ini adalah mengembangkan bahan ajar berupa modul menulis teks berita yang berbasis metode karyawisata. Penelitian ini dilakukan dengan model pengembangan Borg & Gall yang mencakup tiga langkah, yaitu (1) penelitian pendahuluan, (2) pengembangan dan validasi, dan (3) uji coba dan revisi. Penelitian ini melibatkan sejumlah siswa dan guru yang berasal dari tiga Sekolah Menengah Pertama (SMP) di Kabupaten Pesisir Barat, Provinsi Lampung. Dengan modul hasil\r\npengembangan yang telah divalidasi oleh ahli materi, ahli media, dan praktisi, peneliti melakukan uji coba. Selain itu, dengan desain one group pretest posttest peneliti mengolah data perbedaan nilai siswa sebelum dan setelah penggunaan modul pembelajaran menulis teks berita hasil pengembangan. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa modul yang dikembangkan dapat menjawab tantangan belajar siswa dalam\r\nmengembangkan keterampilan menulis teks berita. Dengan penerapan metode karyawisata, siswa dapat mengelaborasi hasil observasi dengan pancaindra dan pikiran mereka untuk menulis teks berita",

      "abstract": "The native speakers of the Lampung language are now very much in the minority on their land. The Lampung language that is almost no longer used as a means of communication in the family domain has led to language loss among children\r\nand young people in Lampung. Although several studies on the Lampung language maintenance have appeared in the literature, the focus was only restricted to language maintenance in general. As a result, no comprehensive\r\ninsights and implications appear to exist. Thus, the aim of this paper is to elucidate the issues through a study which focuses on Lampung language maintenance among young people, which was conducted with a quantitative  approach. The findings of this study indicate that the Lampung language, like other local languages in Indonesia, has issues that need to be seriously addressed so that it can be still maintained a means of communication. Young families of\r\nthe native people of Lampung almost no longer use the Lampung language as a means of communication with other family members and relatives. Therefore, to avoid any potential conflict of interest between the Lampung language and the national language, Indonesian, the findings imply that the preservation and maintenance of the Lampung language should be done through a culture-based approach, which emphasizes a sense of pride and love for the Lampung language as cultural wealth and a product of the civilization of native people of Lampung. The limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are also\r\ndiscussed.",
