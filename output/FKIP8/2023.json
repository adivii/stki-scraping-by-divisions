      "abstract": "Student worksheet development is an activity to improve the quality of the ongoing learning process. The low interest in reading and the value of students at SMK Negeri 2 Metro in the text of the article encourages them to pay attention to the inhibiting factors and try to find alternative teaching materials (Lembar Kerja Peserta Didik) that are interesting and provide creative innovation in learning. The purpose of this study was to develop worksheets to help students build knowledge concepts independently related to the process\/genre-based agronomy articles. This research used the Research and Development (R&D) method. The development research procedure refers to the theory of Borg & Gall, the steps in this study include 1) Preliminary study, 2) data collection, 3) design development\/preliminary product draft (product design), 4) design validation by experts, 5) revision product from initial field trials, 6) product trials, 7) product revision operations. Feasibility value of large-scale trials The presentation feasibility aspect of the two classes obtained an average score of 92.4, the linguistic aspect obtained an average score of 94.23 and graphical aspects get an average score of 94 so that the overall average score becomes 93.5. so that in the final results, the LKPD product \"Article Text of Process Genre-Based Agronomy for Class XII Vocational School Students\" was declared very feasible to use and ready to be tested for effectiveness in learning.",

      "abstract": "According to a variety of academic works, implicature is a tool used by pragmatics to address the issue of linguistic meaning. Grice 1975 holds the following opinion. There have been numerous studies on implicature, primarily looking at conventional and conversational implicatures. However, the results of the conversational implicature research in novels, which is characterized by a breach of the cooperative principle, are still ambiguous. As a result, this study aimed to describe the conversational implicatures in Ahmad Fuadi's novel “Negeri 5 Menara” that are marked by violations of the cooperative principles. A qualitative methodology was used to carry out this study. The novel \"Negeri 5 Menara\" by Ahmad Fuadi served as the study's primary source of data. Conversations between characters that involve violations of the maxims in the cooperation principle serve as the study's source of data. Data were collected by careful reading, looking at sentences with implicatures, selecting, classifying data based on the breach of the violations of the cooperative principles. The collected data were then analyzed descriptively. The study's findings demonstrate that a total of 84 occurrences that violate the cooperative principles were found. The violation of maxims on the principle of cooperation consists of four maxims, namely the maxims of quantity, quality, relation, and manner. The findings have several implications for language education, particularly in the Indonesian context. Limitations and recommendations for furher research are also discussed.",
