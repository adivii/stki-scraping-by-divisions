This study examines the influence of MF on the growth of\r\ntomato infected by Fusarium oxysporum, fungal pathogen that\r\ncauses Fusarium wilt in tomatoes. This factorial study arranged in a\r\nstripe split plot design. Factors tested consists of long exposure to\r\nthe MF, M (control; 7'48 \"; II'42\" and 15'36 \"), how to infect\r\nfusarium, F (through soaking the seeds and by infecting fusarium\r\nthrough the stem at the age 28 days after sowing (das), and soaking\r\nthe seeds, S (soaking and without soaking for 15 minutes before MF\r\ntreatment). Each unit of experiment was repeated 3 times.\r\nParameters measured were percentage of germination, growth rate\r\nbased on plant height, and fresh weight. Observations were made on\r\nthe plant until 42 das. Data were analyzed of variance followed by\r\nthe least significant difference (LSD) test at α = 1 and 5%. The\r\nresults showed that the interaction between MF and fusarium (MxF),\r\nfusarium and soaking (FxS), and MF, fusarium, and soaking\r\n(MxFxS) did not produce a different response on all parameters\r\nmeasured. Differences in response to the treatments derived from the\r\ntreatment of MF (M), Fusarium (F), and the treatment interaction of\r\nthe MF x soaking (MxS). The MF (M) and the interaction of MF and\r\nsoaking (MxS) significantly effect on all parameters measured at\r\neach measurement. The treatment of Fusarium (F) significantly\r\neffect on germination percentage, and fresh weight at 7 das. \r\nKeywords— magnetic field, fusarium, germination percentage,\r\ngrowth rate, fresh weight.",

      "abstract": "Paraquat is a toxic substance that can cause oxidative damage through increased ROS production. Oxidative damage can be prevented by supplementing with antioxidants, such as taurine and oyster mushrooms. This study aims to determine the ability of taurine and oyster mushrooms in preventing oxidative damage of the liver of mice induced by paraquat. This study uses a completely randomized design. A total of 30 DDY mice were divided into five treatment groups for 3 weeks, namely: 1) control, 2) the oyster mushroom (6.25% in feed and 2.5 g\/L in drinking water), 3) paraquat (20\r\nmg\/kg, IP), 4) paraquat and taurine (15.6 g\/kg) and 5) paraquat and oyster mushrooms. Parameters measured were MDA, glutathione, SOD enzyme levels and histopathological changes in liver. The results showed paraquat increases in liver MDA levels significantly but decreases in liver glutathione\r\nlevels  significantly compared to controls, while taurine and oyster mushrooms reduce the levels of MDA (p<0.05) and increase glutahion levels (p<0.05).  Paraquat also increases the levels of SOD (p<0.05), while taurine and oyster mushroom are able to inhibit the increased levels of SOD\r\nalthough they do not show significant (p> 0.05). Paraquat induces liver histopathology change which is characterized by congestion, hydropic degeneration and cloudy swelling. In conclusion, paraquat causes oxidative damage to the liver, while taurine and oyster mushrooms can prevent the damage.",

      "event_dates": "Juli 13-15, 2017",
      "abstract": "Red claw (Cherax quadricarinatus) is one kind of fresh water cray fish with high economic value which encourages farmers to increase their production. However, there are several obstacles where the growth of female individuals is faster than male. To overcome this problem, it is important to undergo a monosex (single gender) cultivation. The aim of this research is to find out the effect of sea cucumber's steroid extract and 17α methyltestosterone at different temperature to sex reversal to males on juvenile freshwater crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus. This research was designed using Factorial Complete Random Design Method. The treatments were observed at temperatures of 27° C and 31ºC as follows: 50 mg\/kg of sea cucumber's steroid extracts at temperatures of 27°C and 31ºC, and 50 mg\/kg of 17α methyltestosterone at temperatures of 27 ° C and 31 ° C. The results showed that the most effective use of steroid extracts of sea cucumber and 17α methyltestosterone was at 27°C to increase the male percentage of 75.16% and 73.79% respectively and gave a significant effect on female genital decrease, total length, daily weight gain and biomass. While giving the steroid hormone did not make a significant effect on survival rate, intersex percentage and feed conversion of juvenile freshwater crayfish.",

The soil fertility was determined based\r\non nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) content and plant (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) growth. Firstly, groups of microfungi were\r\ndetermined based on their decomposition properties on Coffea robusta. L leaf litters. The research covered several decomposition properties\r\nwhich were (1) substrate weight loss, (2) cellulase activity and (3) xylanase activity during the process of decomposition on the pure culture\r\ndecomposition test. Secondly, the microfungi were grouped based on averages of all properties value paired in all possible ways. The result\r\nshowed that there were 10 groups of fungi (P1 – P10) combined based on their decomposition ability. The groups of fungi (P1 – P10) were\r\napplied on sterile soils to determine the NPK content and on pots to observe L. esculentum Mill growth (plant height, leaf sizes, fresh and dry\r\nweight). The effects indicated majority groups of fungi were able to increase NPK content and growth parameters comparing to that of control.\r\nIt concludes that the application of soil saprophytic microfungi on soils are possible to perform this process and able to increase soil fertility.",

Concentration levels of mucoxin applied in theexperiment were 0ng\/ml, 0.1ng\/ml, 0.5ng\/ml, 1ng\/ml, 5ng\/ml and 10ng\/ml. The bax gene expression assayed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods, whereas protein expression of bax and p53 determined by immunocytochemistry techniques. The\r\nresults showed that in comparison with the control, both bax and p53 proteins increase by mucoxin treatment.It is suggested that mucoxin worthy classified as a promising anti-cancer drug."

This study was aimed to deepen understanding on the reproductive behavior of P. peranthus. Observation of mating behavior was made by releasing virgin males and females into a flight cage. Behavioral activities of the insects were observed visually aided by video cameras. Three experimental trials were applied namely one male met one female; three males met one female; and one male met three females. The results depicted in an ethogram that involves male behavioral acts such as flying for searching female, pursuing, hovering and touching female for courting, mounting and grasping the female, flying in tandem to seek a safe perch, relaxed bellow the female upon manage to insert his clasper, and withdrew from pairs and flew away upon finishing copulation. The male mate-locating strategy developed by butterfly P. peranthus is patrolling. \r\n Keywords: Swallowtail butterfly, Papilio peranthus, mating behavior, mate-locating strategy, courtship behavior, behavioral ethogram",

Place and Duration of Study: Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Sciences, University of Lampung, Bandar Lampung, Indonesia between December 2015 and May 2016.  Methodology: Mealybugs that found to infest coffee berries (Coffea robusta L.) were reared and grouped into two. Both groups were fed consecutively with flavonoid fractions of aqueous and methanolic extracts of gamal plant leaves with the concentration of 0% (as control), 0.01%, 0.02%, 0.03%, and 0.04%. The percent mortality of insects was examined at the 12th, 24th, 48th and 72th",

The research was conducted in October - November\r\n2016 in the Laboratory of Plant Physiology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics\r\nand Natural Sciences, University of Lampung. This study uses a completely randomized design\r\n(CRD) with 6 degree of concentration of water extract of the fruit flesh guava: control (Citric\r\nacid 2% w\/v), 0% v\/v, 25% v\/v, 50% v\/v, 75 % v\/v, 100% v\/v. Browning index is determined\r\nbased on the absorbance of the extract of apple Malang at a wavelength of 420 nm. Total\r\nsoluble carbohydrate content was determined by the phenol-sulfuric method, while estimating\r\ndehydrogenase enzyme activity by methylene blue method. Levene's test for homogeneity,\r\nanalysis of variance and LSD test was carried out at 5% significance level. Water extract of\r\nguava fruit has the same effectiveness with citric acid 2% w\/v in inhibiting browning apples\r\nMalang. Similarly, the water extract of guava fruit as well as citric acid 2% w\/v has the same\r\neffect on total soluble carbohydrate content and the activity of the enzyme dehydrogenase.\r\nWater extract of guava fruit has the same effectiveness with citric acid 2% w\/v except for 100%\r\nconcentration on reducing sugar level. The final conclusion is that the water extract of guava\r\nfruit has the different characteristics as citric acid 2% w\/v in inhibiting browning in apples\r\nMalang.\r\nKeywords: water extract of guava fruit, browning index, total soluble carbohydrate content,\r\ndehydrogenase enzyme activity.",

Upaya konservasi gajah sumatera secara genetik dilakukan dengan konstruksi peta filogenetik gajah sumatera tangkapan di Pusat Latihan Gajah (PLG) TNWK yang berujung pada lahirnya breeding policy yang dapat meningkatkan keragaman genetik dalam populasi. Pembuatan Bank Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid (DNA) gajah sumatera di PLG TNWK merupakan langkah awal uji lanjut dalam konstruksi peta filogenetik gajah. DNA telah berhasil diisolasi dari 44 individu gajah sumatera di PLG TNWK dengan metode kolom berdasarkan protokol QIAGEN DNAEasy Kit. Bank DNA hasil isolasi selanjutnya akan dijadikan sebagai bahan dasar amplifikasi dan uji molekuler lebih lanjut. DNA hasil isolasi diuji secara kualitatif dengan elektroforesis gel agarosa 1% yang selanjutnya disimpan dalam -20oC."

      "title": "THE EFFECTIVENESS OF USING STEROID EXTRACT OF SEACUCUMBER \r\nFOR SEX REVERSAL IN JUVENILE REDCLAW CRAYFISH (Cherax quadricarinatus)",
      "event_dates": "15-16 September 2017",
      "abstract": "The freshwater crayfish, red claw Cherax quadricarinatus is commercially cultured in many tropical countries. Males of this species have larger harvest size than females, so it is proposed to culture of all-male population for increasing yields. However this practice has hindrance, since it is difficult to provide monosex seed in high quantity.To overcome this problem, it is important to undergo a monosex (single gender) cultivation. Although sex of C. quadricarinatus is determined by genetics, sex reversal from females to males can be triggered by using steroid hormone at their early juvenile stage. The research was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of sea cucumber's steroid extract for sex reversal from females to males in juvenile crayfish. The research was designed using factorial complete random design. Two different techniques  in giving the steroid hormone, which are by immersion and oral. Two groups of 1-2 weeks old juvenile of C. quadricarinatus were immersed in water containing various doses of  sea cucumber's steroid extract 2 and 4 mg\/L respectively, and the other two groups were administered diet containing either extract of sea cucumber or 17α-methyltestoterone (MT) in dose of 50 mg\/kg diets. Sex ratio, survival and growth rate were observed at the end of 50 days juveniles rearing in aquaria.  Sex differentiation was determined by visual observation. Data was analyzed by Anova and LSD tests. The results showed that  administration of steroid extract of seacucumber was significantly increased the male ratio of crayfish.  Treatment dose of  2 mg\/L during 18 h immersion was effective to increase male sex percentage from 31.03% (control) to 79.86%. On the other hand, 50 mg\/kg of steroid extract of sea cucumber in the diet was more effective to increase the male percentage up to 75,16% than MT. Growth rate of juvenile crayfish, included total length, daily weight gain and biomass, were also significantly improved, while survival rate was insignificant. Thus, the administration steroid extract of seacucumber by both immersion and oral are effective to increase male sex percentage of juvenile crayfish.",

      "abstract": "Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui laju pertumbuhan dan kandungan lipid pada ketiga jenis\r\nmikroalga yang dikultur pada media dengan salinitas yang berbeda. Penelitian dilakukan dengan\r\nmenggunakan metode rancangan acak lengkap faktorial dengan 3 perlakuan yaitu salinitas 20, 30, dan\r\n40 ppt pada mikroalga jenis Nannochloropsis sp., Tetraselmis sp., dan Porpyridium sp masing-masing\r\nsebanyak 3 kali ulangan. Mikroalga dikultur pada skala laboratorium selama 8 hari setelah itu dipanen\r\nuntuk diukur kadar lipidnya. Hasil kultur selama 8 hari menunjukkan laju pertumbuhan spesifik rata-rata\r\ntertinggi pada Nannochloropsis sp. terdapat pada salinitas 40 ppt yaitu 12%\/hari, sedangkan untuk\r\nTetraselmis sp. tertinggi pada salinitas 20 ppt yaitu 7%, dan untuk Porpyridium sp. tertinggi pada salinitas\r\n30 ppt yaitu 5%\/hari. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian diperoleh jumlah lipid tertinggi terdapat pada\r\nTetraselmis sp. pada salinitas 20 ppt yaitu sebesar 2,64% dan jumlah lipid terendah terdapat pada\r\nTetraselmis sp. pada salinitas 40 ppt yaitu sebesar 0,19%. Dari hasil penelitian dapat disimpulkan bahwa\r\nlaju pertumbuhan spesifik rata-rata per hari tertinggi terdapat pada jenis Nannochloropsis sp pada\r\nsalinitas 40 ppt yaitu sebesar 12% dan jumlah lipid tertinggi terdapat pada mikroalga jenis Tetraselmis sp.\r\npada salinitas 20 ppt yaitu sebesar 2,64%.\r\nKata kunci: laju pertumbuhan, lipid, mikroalga, salinitas\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nThe aim of this research was to determine the growth rate and lipids contents of three microalgae that\r\nwere cultured on different medias with different salinity. The experment was conducted by using a\r\nfactorial complete randomized design in three treatmens, they were the salinity levels in 20, 30, and 40,\r\nppt on Nannochloropsys sp., Tetraselmis sp., and Porpyridium sp., each in three replications. The\r\nmicroalgae were cultured in a laboratory scale for eight days and then being harvested to measure their\r\nlypids contents. The result showed that the highest average growth rate was found in Nannochloropsys\r\nsp. at the salinity of 40 ppt for 12% per day, while it was 7% in 20 ppt Tetraselmis sp. , and 5% in 30 ppt\r\nPorpyridium sp. The highest lypids content was found in Tetraselmis sp. In the salinity of 20 ppt for\r\n2,64% and the lowest lypids content was found in Tetraselmis sp. In the salinity of 40 ppt for 0,19%.\r\nBased on the experiment it can be concluded that the highest spesific growth rate per day was found in\r\nNannochloropsis sp in the salinity of 40 ppt for12% and the highest lypids was found Tetraselmis sp. In\r\nthe salinity of 20 ppt for 2,64%.\r\nKey words : growth rate, lypids, microalgae, salinity",

This study aimed to find out whether sexual function of women at\r\nperimenopausal age correlated with their ontogenetic factors, such as the age at menarche and parity. \r\nMethods: Women (n=80) from nine villages in district of Lampung Tengah, Lampung Province, Indonesia aged 4050\r\nyears who meet inclusion criteria participated in the study. Predesigned questionnaire was used to assess socio-demographic characteristics, and the female sexual function index (FSFI) was used to score sexual function of the\r\nrespondents. \r\nResults: None of the 80 respondents smoke, consumes alcohol, and has medical records. Based on the FSFI scores,\r\nexcept for one participant, all respondents suffered from sesual dysfunction with the average of total score 18.77. By\r\nusing median score (18.52) the respondents were dichotomized into two categories, high and low sexual dysfunction. The results of Chi-square analysis and logistic regression showed that respondents with the characteristics of age at menarche <15 years and parity >4 children have better sexual-quality in comparison to those with the age at menarche >15 years and the parity <4 children. \r\nConclusions: It can be concluded that early menarche and high parity might contributed to better sexual-quality of\r\nlife in perimenopausal women."
