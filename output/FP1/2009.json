Research objectives were to 1) identify the level and the cause of horticultural farmers poverty as well as their economic behavior to face the\r\npoverty, 2) asses the performance of economic Enterprises, financial institutions and social institutions of horticulture farmers, and 3) formulate a model of horticultural farmer empowerment. Research carried out in the area of horticultural production\r\ncenters in the Tanggamus District Lampung determined by purposive sampling. Respondents and the number of respondents were determined by using the snowball\r\nsampling technique to the extent \"redundancy\". Research method was participating observation, while data collection techniques was in-depth interviews and focus\r\ngroup discussion. Data analysis was carried out by using qualitative data and SWOT Analysis. The results showed that horticultural farmers were poor and very poor due\r\nto limited land and capital. The quality of human resources was low and they were consumptive. Farmers anticipated their poverty by job diversification and\r\nmaintaining good relationship among each other. Either economic or financial institutions were still controlled by outsiders, and their social institutions were still\r\ndysfunctions. Suggested empowerment model of horticultural farmers was increasing knowledge and skills, providing the capital, forming a marketing institution by the government, strengthening extension and changing farmer’s lifestyle and attitude.",
