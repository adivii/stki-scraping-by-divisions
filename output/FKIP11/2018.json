      "abstract": "This study aims to produce a product in the form of a Project Based Learning model to build a\r\ncompliant attitude to traffic regulations. The study subjects were taken as many as 42 students consisting of 9\r\nlimited test students in small groups, 15 students were limited to large groups and 18 students were field tested.\r\nData collection techniques in the form of questionnaires, interviews and tests. Furthermore, it was analyzed\r\nusing tests of effectiveness, efficiency and attractiveness. The results of the effectiveness data analysis showed\r\nthat N-Gain in the field test was effective because of 0.78≥0.70. Thus based on the calculation of the average NGain normalized to 0.78% with high qualifications so that the use of the Project Based Learning model to build\r\nstudents' obedience towards traffic regulations proved effective. The results of the efficiency data analysis with\r\nthe calculation obtained the value of ratio 1 with high classification, so that the use of project based learning\r\nmodel to build students' obedience towards traffic regulations proved efficiency because 1> 0.5. The results of\r\nthe data analysis are interesting that the use of project based learning model for students' obedience to traffic\r\nrules has proven attractive because it obtained a percentage of 83.3% with an interesting classification.",

The results of the effectiveness data analysis showed that N-Gain in the field test was effective because of 0.78≥0.70. Thus based on the calculation of the average NGain normalized to 0.78% with high qualifications so that the use of the Project Based Learning model to build  students' obedience towards traffic regulations proved effective. The results of the efficiency data analysis with the calculation obtained the value of ratio 1 with high classification, so that the use of project based learning model to build students' obedience towards traffic regulations proved efficiency because 1> 0.5. The results of the data analysis are interesting that the use of project based learning model for students' obedience to traffic rules has proven attractive because it obtained a percentage of 83.3% with an interesting classification.",

The character value of social studies learners, after being taught using the scientific method, was higher than ever with a significance of 0.000 < 0.05. The character of students in the affective domain was influenced by the feelings aspect resulting from the scientific method.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the factors that influence the work readiness of vocational education graduates.The study used a descriptive correlation method. A sample of 20 students was determined by random sampling technique.Data was collected by a closed questionnaire\r\ninstrument with a Likert scale.The work readiness indicator includes four aspects, with the collaboration aspect value (0.82), being critical (0.78), accepting responsibility (0.81), ambition to progress (0.79) and adjusting (0.77 ) Data were analyzed by correlation.The work readiness of vocational education graduates is more influenced by aspects of being critical and collaborating. Thus the aspect of being critical with 0.878 coefficients and collaborating 0.74, thus proven aspects that are able to form work readiness for vocational\r\neducation graduates, not aspects of accepting responsibility, ambition to move forward and adjust."

This study aimed to 1) describe the conditions and potential of English language learning media development based android, 2) Describe English learning media based android, 3) analyze the effectiveness of English learning applications based android; 4) analyze efficiency; 5) analyze the attractiveness of English instructional media through an android application. This research used the design of Research and Development by Borg and Gall consisting of 10 steps, but in this research only consists of 7 steps, that were: research and information collecting, planning, develop preliminary form of product, preliminary field testing, main product revision, operational field testing, and final product revision. The data were collected using observations, questionnaires and tests. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and t-test. The conclusions of this research were: 1).The condition and potential of students for self-learning was high, so it had potential to develop android-based learning applications for English subjects. 2) Produced an android based English learning application, 3). The effectiveness of this media increased with the average post test score of 77.56 with 87% of students reaching minimum completeness criteria, 4) English learning using android based application was 45 minutes more efficient than traditional learning using books or student worksheets, 5) The attractiveness of android-based English learning app was 3,40 with a predicate very attractiveness so it allowed students to improve their learning motivation and creativity.",

Ketiga aspek kompetensi tersebut dirinci dalam sub-sub aspek kompetensi sebagai berikut, a) memetakan dan membuat jaringan kompetensi dasar dan indikator pembelajaran dari berbagai bidang studi, b) merancang rencana pembelajaran berbasis tema, b) melaksanakan pembelajaran berbasis tema, dan c) mengembangkan perangkat pembelajaran sesuai dengan tema yang dirancang. 2) Membangun kerjasama FKIP dengan SD di propinsi Lampung. Target khusus yang ingin dicapai adalah meningkatkan kompetensi guru pada 1) memetakan dan membuat jaringan kompetensi dasar dan indikator pembelajaran dari berbagai bidang studi, 2) merancang rencana pembelajaran berbasis tema, 3) melaksanakan pembelajaran berbasis tema,  dan 4) mengembangkan perangkat pembelajaran sesuai dengan tema yang dirancang. Untuk mencapai target khusus pengabdian dilakukan kegiatan pengabdian dengan metode siklus pengabdian. Kegiatan pengabdian dengan siklus pengabdian terdiri dari 1) menyusun rencana kegiatan, 2) melakukan tindakan pengabdian guna mencapai target pengabdian, 3) observasi terhadap tindakan yang dilakukan dan 4) refleksi terhadap tindakan yang dilakukan guna perbaikan tindakan siklus pengabdian berikutnya.
