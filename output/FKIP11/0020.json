      "abstract": "The purpose of this research and development is to develop and describe the feasibility and effectiveness of developing image media based on Problem Based Learning products to improve student learning communication.\r\nThis type of research and development refers to Borg and Gall theory. The sample was determined by purposive sampling of 16 students of second-grade at Darma Bangsa Elementary School. Data were collected through observation sheets, questionnaires, and test questions. The data analysis technique used the n-Gain test to determine the effectiveness of the results obtained, namely 0.488. The results of the validation of image media\r\nbased on Problem Based Learning are done by material, design and media experts. The results showed that, product development based on Problem Based Learning that is produced effectively is used in the learning process for second-grade students. This is evidenced by the increase in student learning outcomes and student communication skills after using Problem Based Learning based on image media. Keywords: image media, Communication Skills, Problem Based Learning",
