      "abstract": "A teacher training program, named Model-Supported Scientific Inquiry Training Program (MSSITP) has been successfully developed to improve the inquiry skills of Indonesian elementary teachers. The skills enhanced by MSSITP are defining problems, formulating hypotheses, planning and doing investigations, drawing conclusions, and communicating the results. This teacher training program was evaluated by 48 teachers selected by stratified random sampling technique from 48 elementary schools in Bandar Lampung City, Lampung Province, Indonesia. The program was designed to follow Bandura’s stages of social learning: attention,\r\nretention, production, and motivation. The impact of MSSITP was evaluated in three ways. First, by analyzing the improvements of inquiry skills compared to conventional SITP through pretest and posttest control group design. Second, by using an inquiry questionnaire to describe teachers’ perceptions of inquiry learning. Last, by using a response instrument to elicit teachers’ opinions of the program. The results indicate a significant difference (sig 0.00) in teachers’ skills acquired from the two different training programs. Mean posttest scores, varying from 34.7 to 56.9 for the control group and 58.3 to 98.6 for the experimental\r\ngroup, confirmed the effectiveness of MSSITP.",

      "abstract": "A teacher training program, named Model-Supported Scientific Inquiry Training Program (MSSITP) has been successfully developed to improve the inquiry skills of Indonesian elementary teachers. The skills enhanced by MSSITP are defining problems, formulating hypotheses, planning and doing investigations, drawing conclusions, and communicating the results. This teacher training program was evaluated by 48 teachers selected by stratified random sampling technique from 48 elementary schools in Bandar Lampung City, Lampung Province, Indonesia. The program was designed to follow Bandura’s stages of social learning: attention, retention, production, and motivation. The impact of MSSITP was evaluated in three ways. First, by analyzing the improvements of inquiry skills compared to conventional SITP through pretest and posttest control group design. Second, by using an inquiry questionnaire to describe teachers’ perceptions of inquiry learning. Last, by using a response instrument to elicit teachers’ opinions of the program. The results indicate a significant difference (sig 0.00) in teachers’ skills acquired from the two different training programs. Mean posttest scores, varying from 34.7 to 56.9 for the control group and 58.3 to 98.6 for the experimental group, confirmed the effectiveness of MSSITP.",

      "abstract": "Rendahnya Kurangnya engagement siswa \r\nselama fase pelatihan di kelas XI IPA SMA Negeri 7 \r\nBandar Lampung memiliki andil terhadap hasil belajar \r\nmatematikanya. Murid tidak berpartisipasi aktif dalam \r\npelatihan di kelas dengan berinteraksi dengan guru atau \r\nsiswa lain. Pelatihan tipe TGT merupakan komponen \r\ncara belajar kooperatif yang sederhana pelaksanaannya, \r\nmenarik, dan menyenangkan bagi siswa. Ini menyangkut\r\nsiswa yang berpartisipasi dalam kegiatan pelatihan , \r\nsiswa yang bertindak jadi tutor sebaya, dan permainan \r\ndisertakan. Melalui model pelatihan kooperatif TGT, \r\nkajian ini bertujuan guna meningkatkan prestasi siswa \r\ndan acara terkait pelatihan .36 siswa berpartisipasi pada \r\nkajian tindakan kelas ini. Tes dan nontes adalah dua jenis \r\nmetode pengumpulan data. Tes meliputi item untuk \r\nturnamen, sedangkan non-tes memuat observasi, \r\nwawancara, dan dokumentasi. Untuk setiap siklus, \r\nanalisa deskriptif kualitatif dipakai untuk menguji hasil \r\npengamatan, dan analisa deskriptif kuantitatif dipakai \r\nuntuk menguji hasil. Setiap siklus dari turnamen \r\nPenelitian ini memakai tiga siklus. Dengan \r\nmemperhatikan hasil penelitian, model pelatihan \r\nkooperatif Team Games Tournament dapat \r\nmenumbuhkan kegiatan siswa dan hasil belajar \r\nmatematika. Hal ini diperliatkan pada penumbuhan\r\nacara siswa: pada siklus I , skor komulatif acara adalah \r\n61,115 yang termasuk dalam kategori baik; pada siklus II \r\nmeningkat dari 7.944 jadi 69.059 dengan kategori baik; \r\ndan pada siklus III naik lagi dari 8.410 jadi 77.469 yang \r\ntermasuk dalam kategori baik. Rata-rata hasil belajar \r\npada siklus I adalah 71.441, dan terdapat 16 orang yang \r\nmenggapai skor KKM dan 18 orang yang belum \r\nmenggapai skor KKM. Selain itu, terjadi penumbuhan \r\nhasil belajar. Pada siklus II meningkat jadi 79.028 \r\nterdapat 23 orang yang menggapai skor ketuntasan \r\nminimal dan 13 orang yang belum menggapai skorketuntasan minimal, dan pada siklus III meningkat jadi \r\n82,5 yaitu terdapat 30 orang yang menggapai skor KKM \r\nhanya 6 orang yang belum menggapai skor ketuntasan \r\nminimal. Dengan kata lain indikator keberhasilan \r\npenelitian dengan target acara siswa dalam pelatihan \r\nharus tergolong baik dan 83,3 % telah menggapai skor \r\nKKM (N ≥ 76) sudah tercapai.\r\nKeywords: \r\nAktifitas belajar, Hasil \r\nbelajar, TGT(Team Group \r\nTurnamen)",

Banyak organisasi yang profit dan nonprofit tidak dapat survive di masyarakat, karena organisasi tersebut tidak mau belajar dan pemimpinnya tidak mau menerapkan konsep pembelajaran.\r\n\r\nPemimpin di abad 21 ini harus mau menjadi \"market leader\" dan berevolusi untuk membawa organisasinya pada organisasi belajar, sehingga organisasi yang dipimpinnya tetap dapat mencapai visi organisasi tanpa mengesampingkan visi dari masing-masing anggota dalam organisasi tersebut. Organisasi di abad yang penuh ketidakpastian, di abad yang penuh kompetitif, di abad yang cepat berubah, dan abad yang sangat tipis batas-batas kehidupan harus bergerak cepat. Merubah cara pandang terhadap organisasi dan implikasinya terhadap pengelolaan Sumber Daya Manusia (SDM) bukan pengelolaan kapital. Paradigma organisasi harus berubah, dari vertical view\/top down menjadi horizontal view\/bottom up. Organisasi harus beradaptasi dan bertansformasi menjadi learning organizational\/ organisasi belajar. organisasi harus melakukan re-engeneering strategi guna bertahan hidup (survive), outstanding (produktif), dan memperluas pangsa pasar (market share).

      "abstract": "Pendidikan karakter untuk peserta didik dapat dibiasakan melalui pendekatan pembelajaran yang dipilih guru. Salah satu pendekatan pembelajaran yang dapat digunakan oleh guru adalah scientific approach. Dalam implementasinya, beberapa masalah dalam penerapan pendidikan karakter adalah selain belum ada model yang dapat memandu guru dalam pembelajaran, juga karena belum dipahami pentingnya pendidikan karakter dalam pembelajaran, serta minimnya pengalaman praktis guru dalam menerapkan pendidikan karakter. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengembangkan model hipotetik pendidikan karakter berbasis scientific approach (MHPK-BERSIAP) di Sekolah Dasar. Penelitian diawali dengan menggambarkan pendidikan karakter yang telah dilakukan selama ini, kemudian dilakukan kajian teoritik dan diakhiri dengan pengembangan MHPK-BERSIAP di Sekolah Dasar.",

      "abstract": "The Indonesian goverment has issued the policy of inclusion education program in the light of implementing justice principle in education, providing children with easy access to education, and encouraging success in compulsary education. there are 17 elementary schools assumed to run the inclusion education program in 8 regencies\/cities of Lampung Province. This research isto have a look at how the schools run the inclusion program. The research problem is formulated as the following. \"how do the school members perceive the inclusion education program run at the elementary school in Lampung Province?\". The research is intended to describe the perceptions of the school member towards the inclusion education program carried out by the elementary school of Lampung Province, comparising the teachers, curriculum, learning plan, facilities, financing, learning strategis, evaluation, learning achievement, and outcomes. The reserach was conducted at the 17 elementary schools throughout Lampung Province, using quantitative descriptive method. The research population was made up of the principals, school committes, teachers, \"normal\" student's parents, parents of students \"with spesial needs\", and \"normal\" students\". The sampling technique used in this research was random sampling, i.e 25% of the number of the population. In conclusion, the elementary schools assumed to run the inclusion education program were found to be just \"on the way to\" the inculsion education program, since all the subsystems for the program had not been sufficiently provided. This would continuously hold out if the authority did not prepare supporting factors, resulting unachieved program.",

Achieving good learning outcomes involves several components, such as interests, talents, good psychological factors, abilities, motivation, attitudes, maturity, discipline, and others. This study aims to determine the influence of learning interest and discipline on learning motivation. The population was university students, and the sample of the study was all students who took the basic course of curriculum development in 2019-2020, totalling 38 students. Data analysis was performed to describe the condition of each research variable learning interest, discipline, and learning motivation. Data were then analyzed by ANOVA with SPSS Program Version 16. In this study, we found that interest in learning and discipline significantly\r\ninfluenced learning motivation. This relation can be seen in the value of the ANOVA analysis was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Interest in learning influences learning motivation, and this also applies to disciplines that have a strong influence on student motivation. Thus, student learning motivation can be increased by high effort and attention in increasing and developing student interest and discipline. The interest in learning and discipline has a positive influence on learning motivation. Learning motivation is not only influenced by interest and discipline but in this study, it is only limited to interest and discipline, which affect students' learning motivation. Other researchers can do related research talents, good psychological factors, abilities, or attitudes.",

The data have a normal distribution with a significant value of 0.966 and are homogeneous with a significant value of 0.100 > 0.05. The data were analyzed using a paired sample T-test. The character value of social studies learners, after being taught using the scientific method, was higher than ever with a significance of 0.000 < 0.05. The character of students in the affective domain was influenced by the feelings aspect resulting from the scientific method. Thus, using the scientific method in educational interventions improved the character of fifth-grade elementary school students.\r\nKeywords:  Affective domain, elementary school, character education, scientific method",

The purpose of this study is to analyze the factors that influence the work readiness of vocational education graduates.The study used a descriptive correlation method. A sample of 20 students was determined by random sampling technique.Data was collected by a closed questionnaire instrument with a Likert scale.The work readiness indicator includes four aspects, with the collaboration aspect value (0.82), being critical (0.78), accepting responsibility (0.81), ambition to progress (0.79) and adjusting (0.77 ) Data were analyzed by correlation.The work readiness of vocational education graduates is more\r\ninfluenced by aspects of being critical and collaborating. Thus the aspect of being critical with 0.878 coefficients and collaborating 0.74, thus proven aspects that are able to form work readiness for vocational education graduates, not aspects of accepting responsibility, ambition to move forward and adjust. \r\nKey words: work readiness, graduates, vocational education",

The purpose of this study is to analyze the factors that influence the work readiness of vocational education graduates. The study used  a descriptive correlation  method. A sample of 20 students  was determined  by  random  sampling  technique.Data  was  collected  by  a  closed  questionnaire instrument with a Likert scale.The work readiness indicator includes four aspects, with the collaboration aspect value (0.82),  being critical (0.78),  accepting  responsibility (0.81),  ambition to progress  (0.79)  and  adjusting (0.77). Data were analyzed by correlation. The work readiness of vocational  education  graduates  is  more influenced by aspects of being  critical and collaborating. Thus  the aspect of being critical with 0.878 coefficients and collaborating 0.74, thus proven  aspects that are able to form work readiness for vocational education graduates, not aspects of accepting responsibility, ambition to move forward and adjust.\r\nKey words: work readiness, graduates, vocational education",

The problems occurring in this research, students cannot master the material very well. Students did not have interesting in learning and they just had active in their activities. The research used is research and development. In collecting the data, the researcher had three types, observation, interview, and test. The results showed that the interactive CD learning material that was developed met the requirements in accordance with the steps of development. Media validation results and material validation results are shown with an average score of 79.8% and 87.2% respectively.Student responses to interactive learning materials scored 81.75% in small-scale trials while large-scale trials scored 85%. Then the teacher responses scored 71.7% and 80.48%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk: (1) mengembangkan media wordwall yang \r\nlayak dalam peningkatan siswa dalam pembelajaran Bahasa Inggris (2) \r\nmengetahui keberhasilan penggunaan media belajar pada mata pelajaran \r\nbahasa Inggris, khususnya dalam upaya guru meningkatkan \r\nperbendaharaan kosakata siswa. Subjek Penelitian ini adalah siswa SMP \r\nNegeri 34 Bandar Lampung. Peserta didik dapat dikatakan mampu dalam \r\npembelajaran Bahasa Inggris apabila mempunyai kemampuan lebih yang \r\ndimilik yakni kosakata. Menggunakan media yang mendukung dalam \r\npembelajaran kosakata membuat peserta didik lebih memahaminya \r\ndibandingkan menggunakan pembelajaran tanpa menggunakan media. \r\nTidak hanya peserta didik membutuhkan pemahaman kosakata yang \r\nbanyak, seorang pendidik juga harus mempunyai perbendaharaan \r\nkosakata yang lebih banyak. Disesuaikan dengan materi yang diajarkan \r\napabila pendidik mengajar tentang menulis paragraf sederhana, pendidik \r\nmampu memberikan aspek-aspek penilaian dalam menulis. Selanjutnya \r\npemberian pembelajaran kosakata, pendidik mampu menjelaskan makna \r\nkosakata yang ada sehingga sebuah makna kosakata yang mempunyai arti \r\nsecara berhubungan dapat menjadi bahasa yang mempunyai makna. \r\nWordwall adalah sebuah aplikasi yang menarik pada browser. Aplikasi \r\nkhusus yang bertujuan sebagai sumber belajar, media, dan alat penilaian \r\nyang menyenangkan bagi murid. Selain itu juga gratis penggunaannya \r\ndapat dishare lansung melalui facebook, goggle classroom, twitter, atau \r\nmelalui link ke grup WA. Media wordwall diharapkan membantu siswa \r\ndalam pemahaman kosakata siswa tanpa harus selalu tergantung pada \r\npenggunaan kamus. Di dalam melakukan penelitian menggunakan R & D \r\natau yang lebih dikenal dengan Research atau Development yang \r\nmengutip versil Borg dan Gall. Kajian deskriptif analisis mengarah pada\r\npetunjuk pembelajaran Dick and Carey yang mempunyai tahapan terdiri \r\npenyelidikan kebutuhan, rancangan pembelajaran, penerapan \r\npengembangan produk, verifikasi dan perbaikan produk. Pengamatan, \r\npenyebaran angket, dan evaluasi sebagai langkah untuk mendapatkan \r\ndata. Statistik penyebaran diperlukan sebagai evaluasi deskriptif \r\nkuantitatif. Perolehan hasil belajar menggunakan normalisasi atau lebih dikenal N-gain mempunyai fungsi melihat sejauh mana efisiensi \r\npemanfaatan gawai wordwall tersebut. Hasil penilaian dari ahli materi \r\n4.34 Kategori sangat baik. Hasil validasi media 3.70. Dengan kategori baik. \r\nRiset membuktikan: (1) pemanfaatan dalam pembuatan media wordwall\r\nsalah satu pembelajaran meliputi, keahlian, bahan ajar, glossary, evaluasi \r\nserta berbagai jenis permainan dalam gawai tersebut, (2) pemanfaatan \r\nmedia wordwall dapat di implementasikan untuk sumber belajar \r\nkhususnya pembelajaran perbendaharaan kosakata.\r\nKata kunci: media interaktif, Wordwall, perbendaharaan kat",

One  of  them  is  Faculty  of  Mathematics  and  Natural  Sciences  which  includes  Computer  ScienceDepartment.  The Computer Science Department applies the process of study preparationinto a system. The study preparation cannot be separated  from  the  tools  or  equipment  of  teaching  materials  because  they are  needed  in  the  learning  process  of  each subject. At this time the process of teaching preparation materials on the web-based information system in the Department of Computer Science has not been applied. Therefore, with the addition of the feature of making teaching materials in the form  of  handouts  with  the  Laravel framework  on  a  web-based  lecture  information  system,  it  is  hoped  that  can  assist lecturers in preparing teaching materials and assist administrators, faculty, and students in finding teaching materials so that they can be printed. The conclusion of this research is that the feature of making teaching materials in the form of handouts with the Laravel framework on a web-based lecture filing information system has been successfully added.\r\nKeywords:Framework Laravel; Handout; Information System;Teaching Material",

However, students find it difficult to \r\nwrite and develop procedural texts such as the lack of \r\ninteresting media to support learning in writing \r\nprocedural texts. Teachers still use environment-based \r\nmedia and lectures. Android-based learning is learning \r\nthat uses innovative, creative, and interesting learning \r\ninnovation media. The purpose of this study is to facilitate \r\nthe interaction of students with the subject matter, \r\nstudents with teachers, and between students. This study \r\nuses the SLR method, the data obtained based on \r\nobservations with the help of article reviews and \r\ndocumentation. The results of the research obtained are \r\nlearning innovations based on android applications \r\nprovide many benefits for students in developing ideas \r\nand making writings with interesting learning media. \r\nWith these innovations, teachers and students gain \r\nexperience in making applications and can be creative in \r\nthe learning process which of course can utilize \r\ntechnology in learning and meet the achievement of \r\nlearning objectives so as to make learning interesting and \r\nfun for teachers and students.\r\nKeywords: \r\ninnovation, android \r\napplication, procedure text",

It employed descriptive quantitative evaluation by using CIPP (context, input, process of implementation and product) evaluation model. Participants included the head of the Education and Culture Department, Ministry of Religion, Principals\r\n\/ Madrasas, teachers, and students. To collect the data, questionnaires, interviews, focus group discussions, and documentaries were undertaken. Additionally, the data analysis technique used quantitative and qualitative descriptive statistics. The findings indicate that (1) implementation of the UN and USBN, which has been ongoing, is in accordance with the standard operating procedure (SOP)\r\nthat has been established by the board of national education standard (BNSP), (2) implementation of UN and USBN can be used to improve performance (3) the final examination system that is able to measure achievement of graduates' competency on certain subjects nationally by referring to the Graduate Competency Standard is computer-based national examination (UNBK). The concluding remarks are an attempt to contribute to the growth of future research in the field of UN and USBN implementation in Indonesia. \r\nKeywords: Evaluation, National Examination (UN), National-Based School Examination (UNBK).",

The number of school library visitors at SMAN 14 Bandar Lampung, with a total of 1052 students in 30 study groups 2018\/2019 academic year. It can be seen that the number of library visitors is not more than 500 students per month, the number of books borrowing does not reach 500 copies per month.This study uses an interpretive \/ constructivist paradigm, through this paradigm the researcher analyzes the need for developing a hypothetical model of library management as a learning resource center.Based on the potential and condition of 17 libraries in Bandar Lampung High School there are still libraries that do not meet the SNP standards, namely 11 school libraries that have manual management without following the library management system.At the stage of developing the hypothetical model, the researcher examines a problem that is developed to obtain responses that tend to be positive to teachers, library principals and school principals, marked by a positive category average of 80.15% while negative category responses are only 20.85%.",

This study aims to 1) develop a test instrument for higher order thinking skills based on outdoor learning in elementary schools; 2) validate the test instrument through expert validation and empirical validity. Expert validation is carried out by consulting the product development design with expert lecturers. Empirical validity was carried out using the product moment correlation formula, while the determination of reliability used the Cronbach Alpha formula. The research method uses Design Based Research. The development of this model is carried out in stages 1) identification and problem analysis by researchers and practitioners collaboratively 2) developing solutions based on theoretical benchmarks, existing design principles and technological innovations 3) carrying out an iterative process to test and improve practical solutions 4) reflection to produce design principles and improve implementation of practical solutions. The results of the study are 1) 22 items of higher order thinking skills; 2) validation by experts states that this assessment instrument is suitable for use as an assessment tool, while in empirical validation it is stated that the overall results of the test using the product moment formula of the items have been declared valid. Determination of reliability using Cronbach's alpha formula has a reliability value of 0.935 which is categorized as high reliable. Overall, in this development research, this higher-order thinking ability assessment instrument is valid and reliable as a form of assessment. \r\nKeywords: Thematic Learning, Outdoor Learning, Grade V Elementary School Students",

      "abstract": "Achievement of the objectives of lectures by Degeng (1989) was influenced by variable conditions and learning systems. Variable conditions include: 1) the characteristics of students, 2) subjects, and 3) problems. Student characteristics S2 in PPs TP FKIP Unila have a variety S1 graduation. There are from S1 medicine, obstetrics, pure Mathematics, economics, education and others. Behind  the  diversity there is in common work setting S2 students  who study at TP FKIP Unila PPs, that similarity is their work in the field of education. This means that there are differences in prior knowledge  S2  students  to  take  a  course in curriculum development and learning  system.  Differences initial knowledge in a lecture  needs  to  be addressed, including through the provision of assistance to students who do not come from the S1 education to  be  able  to take the classes in accordance with the contract  that  has been set. The next condition variable is a characteristic of the course curriculum development  and learning system. Characteristics of the course curriculum development and learning system for S2 students of TP FKIP Unila, in contrast to the same subject in different PPs. The specificity of the core subjects is unification hierarchies,  structural and combination of curriculum, development, and  its  relation to the learning system.  That requires a  device that is able to accommodate  the  characteristics  of  the  lecture content as intended.  Based on objective analysis  of lectures, student characteristics and  characteristics  variable subjects, concluded needed learning tools for curriculum development with an initial knowledge about curriculum content and its relation to learning systems, development presented by the hierarchy, structural and  composite.  The aspect of learning  as  defined had not yet  available. That requires the development of learning  aspects  that  can  achieve the course objectives  to  the  fullest. The research  objective  is to develop aspects appropriate in learning curriculum  development with student  characteristics S2 TP FKIP  Unila,  the characteristics  of  the  course  itself and  the existing constraints. To achieve the goal of the development is done using a model of R & D which  consists  of  the  stages  include product trials.  Activities  include individual and small group testing, field testing and dissemination in Lampung  province.  Development  produces textbooks that have content validity appropriate for lectures, reading level, the  attractiveness of the good category.",

      "abstract": "Pendidikan alternatif sebagai pilihan alternatif bagi masyarakat yang memiliki akses pendidikan terbatas, dan\r\npelaksanaan pendidikan alternatif memiliki kontribusi signifikan untuk mencapai tujuan pendidikan nasional.\r\nSejak pendidikan alternatif ada di Kota Bandar Lampung, tidak ada proses evaluasi yang dilakukan ke sekolah-sekolah pendidikan alternatif. Jadi, merupakan suatu keharusan untuk mengevaluasi sekolah-sekolah tersebut untuk mendapatkan informasi dalam membantu pembuat kebijakan untuk memiliki keputusan yang baik terkait dengan pendidikan alternatif di kota Bandar Lampung. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mendapatkan informasi dan mendeskripsikan secara empiris tentang pendidikan alternatif, dan memberikan rekomendasi\r\nkepada instansi terkait seperti dinas pendidikan kabupaten tentang: (1) masyarakat, lembaga \/ lembaga pelaksana, dan persepsi siswa tentang pendidikan alternatif. (2) prestasi belajar siswa, (3) sistem pembelajaran,(3) faktor pendukung, dan (5) hambatan untuk melaksanakan pendidikan alternatif di Kota Bandar Lampung. Teknik purposive sampling digunakan dalam penelitian ini, dan data dikumpulkan dengan menggunakan kuesioner, wawancara mendalam, dan studi dokumentasi. Data dianalisis dengan menggunakan teknik\r\ndeskriptif kualitatif. Rekomendasi untuk masa yang akan datang: (1) Untuk siswa sekolah RoKiA (12 kelas)yang memiliki kompetensi dalam sains dapat mengembangkan minat dan kompetensi mereka, akan lebih baik bagi mereka untuk diizinkan oleh dinas pendidikan kabupaten untuk mengikuti ujian atau sains Paket C ujian yang setara, (2) Agar lebih efisien, akan lebih baik bagi sekolah RoKiA untuk memiliki rasio murid-guru sesuai dengan standar nasional atau setidaknya 1: 10, (3) Untuk melaksanakan artikel UU Guru No. 14\/2005 8,9, dan 11, akan lebih baik bagi guru sekolah RoKiA untuk memiliki setidaknya kualifikasi akademik S1 atau\r\nD4, dan sertifikat guru sebagai pendidik profesional, dan (4) pemerintah daerah harus lebih proaktif untuk memberikan perhatian dan dukungan terhadap alternatif lembaga pendidikan seperti sekolah RoKiA.",

      "abstract": "the aim of the research is to investigate strategies use by students taking part in translation class. the strategies which are frequently considered \"errors\" but in fact show their tactics to overcome their problem at hand. the participants of the research comprised 50 undergraduated students taking a translation course at Lampung University, Indonesia. The research last for four months in 2010 during the lecturing hours. The researcher was one of translation lecturer not only at diploma program but also at a graduate program where the two programs run a translation course. The research is qualitative by nature. a protocol analysis was used a major data collecting instrument. Other instruments were obserrvation and interviews. The participants were assigned to translate various text of different genres after they were trained on how to translate ideas from a source language into a target language. the protocols were then coded and analyzed to identify what kinds of goofing while the participants were on the process of translation or disscussion of their translation with their peers. Interview was intended to get the data on how they translated, why they translated in the way analysis-based data. the findings show that majority of goofing that the participants committed was developmental. such kind of goofing can be easily eradicated by exposure and appropriate training role in minimizing their goofing. Therefore, the lectures of translation are suggested that they should provide a lot of exposure and appropriate training on how to translate communicatively. they are also suggested that they should provide feedback for every transition assigment or work to the participants so that they could take benefits from such feedback.",

The number of school library visitors at SMAN 14 Bandar Lampung, with a total of 1052 students in 30 study groups 2018\/2019 academic year. It can be seen that the number of library visitors is not more than 500 students per month, the number of books borrowing does not reach 500 copies per month.This study uses an interpretive \/ constructivist paradigm, through this paradigm the researcher analyzes the need for developing a hypothetical model of library management as a learning resource center.Based on the potential and condition of 17 libraries in Bandar Lampung High School there are still libraries that do not meet the SNP standards, namely 11 school libraries that have manual management without following the library management system.At the stage of developing the hypothetical model, the researcher examines a problem that is developed to obtain responses that tend to be positive to teachers, library principals and school principals, marked by a positive category average of 80.15% while negative category responses are only 20.85%.",
