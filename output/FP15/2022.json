      "abstract": "Rice  (Oryza  sativa)  is  susceptible  to  damage  during  storage  including quantity  and  quality.  Rice during  storage  for  a  long  time  will  experience  a  decrease  in  quality  both  chemically  and  physically. This  study  was  aims  to  determine  the  chemical  and  physical  properties  of  rice  attacked  by  lice (Sitophyllus  oryzae  sp).  The  experiment  was  arranged  in  a  Randomized  Completely  Block  Design (RCBD)  with  treatments in  the  form  of samples of commercial rice,  rice  free  of  lice,  rice  attacked  by lice.and by product of lice-attacted rice. The study consisted of 4 treatments with 6 replications. The data will be statistically tested using the SPSS 25 application. All data are further processed with the Least Significant Difference Test (BNT\/LSD) at the 5% level. The chemical properties of rice infested with  lice  cause  an  increase  in  moisture  content,  lower  protein  content  and  total starch  content.  The physical properties of rice attacked by lice caused a decrease in water absorption, oil absorption and whiteness. The results showed that rice that was attacked by pests with moisture content of 13.23%, crude protein content 4.90%, total starch content73.82%, water absorption capacity of 2.09 g\/g, oil absorption capacity of 1.93 g\/g and whiteness of 80.23",

      "abstract": "The study's objective was to evaluate the cream cheese characteristics made from Lampung farmer's milk improved by combining 2% xanthan gum and 1% gelatin as stabilizers on different curd recovery ways. The cream cheese samples were prepared by three treatments, namely (T1) stabilizer application on curd without whey separation, (T2) no stabilizer application on curd with whey separation, and (T3) stabilizer application on curd with whey separation. All experiments were repeated three times. Results demonstrated that the addition of stabilizer (xanthan gum and gelatin) with or without whey separation had a better impact on the proportional protein, fat, yield, and texture, and spreadability. In addition, stabilizer addition had no adverse effect on the color, taste, and aroma of all cheese cream. Nevertheless, cream cheese without whey separation had higher moisture content than those with whey separation even though with stabilizer added. Therefore, it was possible to explore cream cheese made from Lampung farmers' milk with a stabilizer and whey separation application",
