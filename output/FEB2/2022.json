      "abstract": "This community service project aims to assist and encourage Adijaya Village\r\nSeedling Garden in developing digital marketing strategies and conducting\r\nbusiness feasibility studies. Adijaya Village Seedling Garden (VSG), Pekalongan,\r\nEast Lampung, is an example of how digital marketing is not commonly\r\nemployed, especially in areas and villages. Another issue is that partners lack the\r\nnecessary skills to write Business Feasibility Study Reports. Partners require the\r\ncreation of a Firm Feasibility Study Report in order to reduce the danger of loss\r\nby determining whether or not a business can be run continually. This service\r\nactivity's execution technique includes training and guidance in order to lay the\r\ngroundwork for online marketing in Adijaya village and business feasibility\r\nstudies. This service activity went off without a hitch, and the participants were\r\nenthusiastic in their participation. The training participants should be able to\r\nunderstand and implement marketing strategies as well as conduct business\r\nfeasibility studies as a result of this activity.",

This study aims to analyze the effect of GRDP per Capita on multidimensional poverty. The method used to measure multidimensional poverty in this study is the Alkire Foster method. The multidimensional poverty index that was built refers to the index developed by Alkire and Santos, as well as several previous studies with several changes that were adjusted to the availability of data. The results of this study resulted in panel data regression analysis and involved the HDI control variable. It was found that partially, economic growth as measured by gross regional domestic product per capita at constant market prices in 2010 had no significant effect on the multidimensional poverty rate in Lampung Province, Indonesia 2017-2019",
