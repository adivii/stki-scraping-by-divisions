      "abstract": "The research was directed towards apprehending the kinship system among the Javanese community seen from kinship concepts and terminologists, as well as understanding the factors influencing the changes over the system.    The research was qualitative.    The research site was in Jagabaya Neighborhood, Sukabumi Sub  District in the City of Bandar Lampung.   Data were collected through in-depth interviews upon 5 informed which were chosen using the snowball technique,  as well as were collected through observations.   Dara was then analyzed using data reduction, display, and verification techniques.  The research indicates that the kinship system among the Javanese community has been shifting in the function of a family tree,  in the terminologies used to call family members from father and mother sides,  and in the languagesfor their daily use.\r\n\r\nThe shifts,  however.  can be reduced by using kinship terminologies mutually approved by the kinship members.    The unfunctional family tree used for finding the ancestors ofthe families has to lead to an unclear kinship relationship. as well as unclear ancestry and functions ofterminologies.   The terminology of .. bulik\" (aunty in Java Island kinship term) became \"tante'' (aunty in modern term) or even \"mbak\" (sister) or even just plainly call by name which is strange in Javanese community in the  Island of Jawa.    \"Krama\"  (high or honorable terms) was no longer   used and even were seen as strange  to communicate\r\nwith older people,  they prefer to use \"ngoko\" or plain words instead",
