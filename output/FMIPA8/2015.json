      "abstract": "The objective of this study is to examine empirically the impact of defense spending on unemployment along with a number of control variables for a set of five selected countries from Asia which include Cambodia, China, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. For empirical investigation annual data over the period of 1992 to 2013 are used. While, prior to regression analysis, the data were sensibly checked using sundry of relevant tests. The empirical results reveal that defense spending is not a better option to overcome unemployment problem in most of the sample countries. Thus, the findings suggest that lower defense budget allocation will provide more resources for other sectors which are relatively more productive and can help to improve economic and social welfare of these selected countries from Asia. Besides decreased military expenditures, encouraging domestic investment and discouraging population growth can help reduce unemployment. Remittance appears to have a positive relation with unemployment, the implications of which need to be addressed by policymakers.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Defense Spending, Unemployment, Cross Country Data, Asian Countries",

To find the best model, first we evaluate the stationary of the data by using time series plot, Autocorrelation Function (ACF), and Unit root Test. Then the Time Series model was found by using ACF and Partial Autocorrelations Function (PACF). The best model was found by using the criteria: Mean Squares Error (MSE), Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC. Based on this criteria the best modelfound in this paper is ARIMA (1,1,0) compare to ARIMA (0,1,1), and ARIMA(1,1,1).",

In the Markov Chain model the states are\r\nSumatra, Jawa, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Maluku and Papua and are abbreviated as S, J, K, SL and OI respectively. From\r\nthe transition probability matrices, the states are communicated to each other and irreducible. From the results of analysis, \r\nthere are similar stationary probability within the states Jawa, Sulawesi and Maluku and Papua, but slightly change in the\r\nSumatra and Kalimantan. From the stationary probability results it shows that in the long run that the stationary probability\r\nof migration enter Sumatra decrease from 0.3895 in 1980 to 0.2720 in 2010. On the other hand, the stationary probability\r\nof migration enter Kalimantan increase from 0.0726 in 1980 to 0.1537 in 2010. From the analysis of mechanism of\r\nmigration in 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010.  Jawa becomes the main destination of migration from other islands. The people\r\nfrom Sumatra, if they migrate high probability they will migrate to Jawa. On the other hand, the people from Jawa, if they\r\nmigrate high probability they will migrate to Sumatra. The people from Kalimantan, if they migrate high probability they\r\nwill migrate to Jawa or Sulawesi in 1980 and in 2010, but high probability only to Jawa in 1990 and in 2000. The people\r\nfrom Sulawesi, if they migrate high probability they will migrate to Jawa, Kalimantan or Maluku and Papua in 1980 and in\r\n1990, but in 2000 and in 2010, high probability they will migrate to Kalimantan and Maluku and Papua.

      "abstract": "In the Great Giant Pineapples Company, the problem of prediction of weight of fruits at harvest has become a long critical problem for the planning, cannery and marketing. The company has been trying for a long time to find the best method to predict the production of pineapple weight per hectare by using the information of plant weight. It is well known that the fruit weight has linear relationship with the pineapples plant weight. In this study, the modeling and prediction of pineapples plant weight will be discussed based on some factors. The experiment have been conducted in four difference locations and cultivar classes and varieties, namely location 094D with cultivar class Medium Crown and variety GP1, location 126C with cultivar class Medium Crown and variety GP1, location 158H with cultivar class Small Crown and variety GP1and in location 576D with cultivar class Medium Crown and variety GP1. The age of plants are 15 months of age. From each location 40 data has been taken by method of systematic random sampling. Than from each datum the plant weight (W) in kg, number of perfect leaves (NPL), the length of the longest leaf (LLL) in cm, and the width of the longest leaf (WLL) in cm are measured. From the analysis the plant weight best predicted by using variables NPL, LLL, and WLL in all locations",

The data are collected from the alumni data of University of Lampung, from 2010 to 2013 and about 9060 alumni involved. In this study, the variables of interest are: Length of Study with three categories (<4.5 years; 4.5- 5.5 years; and >5.5 years), Field of Study with three categories (Sciences, Social Sciences, and Education), Sex with two categories (Male, and Female), GPA in scale 0 to 4 with three categories ( <3.0, 3.0-3.5, and >3.5). In this study the aims are going to find the\r\nbest model to explain the relationship among the factors. By using hierarchical Log-linear Model Analysis and backward method it was found that the best model for the data with three variables interactions in the model are: Length of Study*SEX*GPA, Length of Study*Sciences*GPA, and Sex*Sciences*GPA.",

The Multi Periods Degree Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree Problem (MPDCMST) is a problem that concerns about finding a minimum networks installations for a certain commodity so that the networks does not violate the reliability restriction whilst also satisfying the fund limitation in every stages of installations. In this paper we proposed three algorithms by modifying Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms. We implemented our algorithms on 300 generated problems with vertex order ranging from 10 to 100, and compared them with those that were already in the literature. The result shows that the algorithms proposed perform  better",
