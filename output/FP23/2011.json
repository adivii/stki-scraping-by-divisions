The main problem in land covered by alang-alang ere poorly in soil physical, chemical and biological properties. This experiment aims were to study the changes in soil physical, chemical and biological properies at different ages of growth alang-alang in its land. The experiment was arranged by split plots in a randomized block design. The min plot was the age of alang-alang (1,5 and >10 years) and the sub-plot were  depth of soil (0-5, 5-15 and 15-30 cm). The results showed that the age of covered alang-alang have a capability to improve physical, chemical and biological soil properties of soil. Magnesium increased up to 239% (5 years) and 71% (age >10 years) compared to land covered by alang-alang at the age of 1 year. For biological properties, land covered by alang-alang increased of earthworm population up to 66,45% (5 YARS) AND 56% (age > 10 years) higher than land that od the age of 1 year.",

Pada sistem OTK tanah diolah seperlunya saja dan mulsa dari residu tanaman sebelumnya dibiarkan menutupi permukaan lahan. Dengan memanfaatkan residu tanaman dan mengurangi manipulasi\r\nmekanis permukaan tanah, pertanian OTK mempunyai potensi dalam membantu mengurangi pemanasan global melalui penyerapan C dalam tanah dan penguraogin emisi CO2. Percobaan ini bertujuan mempelajari peran olah tanah konservasi dalam mengurangi emisi CO2-sebagai salah\r\nsatu gas rumah kaca. Percobaan dirancang secara faktorial dalam RAK. Faktor pertama adalah perlakuan sistem olah tanah, yaitu olah tanah intensif (OTI), olah tanah minimum (OTM) dan tanpa olah tanah (TOT),dan faktor kedua pemupukan N dengan dosis O, 100 dan 200 kg N ha-1. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan emisi gas CO2 pada pertanian jagung OTI dengan pemupukan 200 kg N\/ha pada hari ke-l setelah pengolahan\r\ntanah mencapai 59,89 kg co2lha\/hari, 3,8 kali emisi gas co2 ToT. Emisi gas CO2 OTI hari kedua dan ketiga setelah pengolahan berturut-turut mencapai 52.8 dan 44,1 kg CO2\/ha\/hari; 5,1 dan 3,8 kali emisi CO2 TOT. Emisi total CO2 pada OTI mencapai 1,17 ton\/ha selama musim tanam jagung, setara dengan 4,3 kali emisi TOT dan 2,7 kali OTM.",

      "abstract": "Shallot cultivation has constraints in regarding less fertile soil and lacking of soil nutrients. This study aimed to determine the effect of suspension extracts of the agro-industrial plant wastes (banana weevil, pineapple rhizome, and oil palm empty fruit bunches) and the type of compost (solid and liquid compost) on the soil chemical properties and the yields of shallot. The study used a Completely Randomized Block Design arranged in a factorial treatment. The first factor was the type of suspension extract of agro-industrial plant wastes, namely banana weevil (P1), pineapple rhizome (P2), and oil palm empty fruit bunches (P3). The second factor was the type of compost, namely without compost (K0), solid compost (K1), and liquid compost (K2). Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and followed by a Duncan Multiple Range Test at 5% level. The results showed that the suspension extract type of agro-industrial plant wastes and the compost type increased the pH, available-P, and organic-C of soil, but they did not affect the total-N and exchangeable-K of soil. The application suspension extract of oil palm empty fruit bunch significantly increased the volume of the bulb of shallot compared to the suspension extract of pineapple rhizome and banana weevil. Moreover, the application of compost (either solid or liquid) significantly increased the volume of the bulb of shallot compared to without compost. The application of suspension extract of oil palm empty fruit bunch with solid compost significantly increased the weight of the wet and dried bulbs compared to the suspension extracts of banana weevil and pineapple rhizomes. Also, the application of solid compost with suspension extract of oil palm empty fruit bunch significantly increased the weight of wet bulbs and dried bulbs of shallot compared to without compost and liquid compost. Therefore, the suspension extract of agro-industrial plant wastes has a potential to be used as liquid organic fertilizers.",

The treatments were arranged in a factorial (3x3) in a randomized completely block design with 3 replications. The first factor was tillage systems, namely intensive tillage (IT) system, minimum tillage (MT) system, and no tillage (NT) system, and the second factor was the long-term application of nitrogen fertilizer, namely 0, 100, and 200 kg N ha-1. Data were analyzed using an orthogonal contrast test and a correlation test between SMBC and organic-C, total-N, and pH of the soil. The results showed that, in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere of maize plant, MT system increased the SMBC compared to NT and IT systems. However, application of long-term application of nitrogen fertilizer did not increase the SMBC. Nevertheless, fertilizer application of 100 kg N ha-1 increased the SMBC compare to 200 kg N ha-1. Furthermore, the combination of MT system and 100 kg N ha-1 could increase the SMBC compared to the other combined treatment between tillage systems and N fertilization doses. The SMBC was higher in the rhizosphere than in non-rhizosphere of maize plant.",

      "abstract": "Surround a big river estuary coastline has a dynamic characteristic and change along a period of time, because of a natural process and\/or it is accelerated by human activities. The surround Sekampung river estuary coastline located in Rawa Sragi area is one of the most dynamic coastlines in southern Lampung Province that has changed significantly from 1959 (as a natural process) to year 1987 (as an accelerated process by human activities) since the government of Indonesia has applied swamp drainage system for Rawa Sragi area. It is likely that the coastline has changed significantly in the period of 1987 to 2009 (as an increasing intensity of the human activities in the surrounding Rawa Sragi land). The objective of this research was to analyze the coastline change in the surrounding of Sekampung river estuary in two periods of time: (1) the change of the 1959 – 1987 period coastlines; and (2) the change of the 1987 – 2009 period coastlines. The method of this research was a GIS technique, the implementation was divided into three main steps: (1) the first analysis was conducted in laboratory include raster data source analysis and registration, coastline digitations, and overlaying and analysis of the coastline data; (2) field observation (ground check) was conducted to observe and verify the ground existing coastline; and (3) the last analysis was conducted after ground check activity to improve and to verify the first coastline analysis results. The result of this research indicated that coastline change in the period of 1959 to 1987 increased the coast land as much as 717.19 hectares, but decreased the coast land as much as 308.51 hectares. Furthermore the coastline change in the period of 1987 to 2009 increased the coast land as much as 162.504 hectares, but decreased the coast land as much as 492.734 hectares. The 1959 – 1987 coastline change was a coast land increasing period, but the 1987 – 2009 coastline change was a coast land decreasing period.",

A greenhouse experiment was conducted to study the effect of singly nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium or their combination on soil ammonia (NH4+) content that was treated by Azolla, and to study Azolla decomposition in paddy soils. The experiment was arranged by randomized completely block design with three replications. The treatments in soil were control (without NPK), fertilizers), four nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium PK, NP, and NK with each dosage at 100 kg ha-1.  The observations were conducted at 3, 5, 7, 14, and 2l days after treated. \"The results showed that fertilization with N, P, or K and their combination give significantly effect on NH4+ content in soil. NH4+ content was higher in soil treated with NPK, NP, or NK than that in control or PK at 3, 7, and 14 days after.treatment. The NH4+  content in soil increased with the time of incorporated of Azolla in paddy soil. Dffirences in soil nutrient were not significantly effect on N and C content of Azolla as well as decomposition rate of Azolla. However, N- total of Azolla increased and C-total of Azolla decreased along with decomposition of Azolla in paddy soil."

      "abstract": "Indonesia is one of the most important areas of tropical forests worldwide that have great potential for the future development of agriculture. However, most of these soils have low inherent fertility and many have become degraded. Land degradation has been a problem because of its adverse impact on agronomic productivity, the environment, and its effect on food security and the quality of life.  Factors affecting the degradation are agricultural activities, deforestation and removal of natural vegetation, over-exploitation of vegetation for domestic use, overgrazing, and industrial activities. Productivity of soil decrease because of lack of physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil.  One of important approach that can be done is by biological management such as, utilization of plant biomass either as mulch or mixed into the soil, reduce tillage, cover crop, or crop rotation that can enhance soil biodiversity.  Soil biota is powerful for many kind of agro ecosystem process such as chemical engineers, biological regulators, and ecosystem engineers.  Moreover, soil biodiversity will service many things in below and above ground such as soil structure, soil organic matter and fertility, regulation of carbon flux and climate control, regulation of the water cycle, decontamination and bioremediation, pest control, and human health.",

      "abstract": "A 0.01 M CaCl(2) extraction is often used to asses the bioavailability of plant nutrients in soils. However, almost no correlation was found between selenium (Se) in the soil extraction and Se content in grass. The recently developed anion Donnan membrane technique was used to analyze chemical speciation of Se in the 0.01 M CaCl(2) extractions of grassland soils and fractionation of DOC (dissolved organic carbon). The results show that most of Se (67-86%) in the extractions (15 samples) are colloidal-sized Se. Only 13-34% of extractable Se are selenate, selenite and small organic Se (<1 nm). Colloidal Se is, most likely, Se bound to or incorporated in colloidal-sized organic matter. The dominant form of small Se compounds (selenate, selenite\/small organic compounds) depends on soil. A total of 47-85% of DOC is colloidal-sized and 15-53% are small organic molecules (<1 nm). In combination with soluble S (sulfur) and\/or P (phosphor), concentration of small DOC can explain most of the variability of Se content in grass. The results indicate that mineralization of organic Se is the most important factor that controls Se availability in soils. Competition with sulfate and phosphate needs to be taken into account. Further research is needed to verify if concentration of small DOC is a good indicator of mineralization of soil organic matter.",
