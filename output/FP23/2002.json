      "abstract": "Soil loss and surface runo# from farmland under co#ee trees with di#erent weed managements\r\nwere investigated in Lampung, South Sumatra, Indonesia during rainy seasons from +330 to +333.\r\nThree treatment practices investigated were as follows : co#ee without cover crop ; co#ee with\r\nPaspalum conjugatum sp. as cover crop, and co#ee with natural weeds. Weed management was\r\ndone every two week by clearing all the weeds in co#ee plot, and cutting the weeds around the\r\nco#ee trees with diameter + m for the weedy plots. The results showed that the maximum daily\r\nrainfall and intensity based on +* minutes observation were 2,mm\/day and +,* mm\/h, however,\r\nonly +..,�of rainfall intensities was greater than ,\/mm\/h (classified as erosive rainfall intensity).\r\nA relationship between erosivity index (R) and daily rainfall (X) was found as follows : R�+.0,.\r\n(X�+*.3), where R : daily erosivity index (m, · t\/ha\/h) and X : daily rainfall (mm\/day). The runo#\r\nratio for cleanoweeded co#ee ranged from 1.* to +\/.3�, and decreased after the second year\r\nbecause of the co#ee canopy growth. The presence of Paspalum conjugatum had reduced runo#\r\nuntil zero after the third year, whereas in natural weeds plot, runo# became zero after the fourth\r\nyear. The highest soil loss was found in cleanoweeded co#ee which reached ,,.1 t\/ha in the\r\nsecond year of experiment. The use of cover crop could suppress soil loss until zero after the third\r\nyear in Paspalum plot and after the fourth year in natural weeds plot. However the good\r\nmanagement of weeds as cover crops is necessary due to the bad performance of co#ee growth at\r\nboth weedy plots. The average soil loss from cleanoweeded co#ee plot was +.,.mm per year\r\nwhich was below the soil formation rate in Indonesia",

      "abstract": "Sediments transported from various land uses and entrapped by natural vegetative ﬁlter were measured from January to November +333 in a hilly humid tropical area of Lampung, South Sumatra, Indonesia. A very simple sediment trap made from a PVC pipe with diameter of +*.3 cm was designed for measuring the sediment yield. Five types of land uses were chosen as follows : (a) co#ee garden in multistrata system followed by rain-fed agriculture and grass ﬁlter, (b)\r\nmixed-co#ee garden followed by short shrub ﬁlter, (c) clean-weeded co#ee garden followed by long shrub ﬁlter, (d) clean-weeded co#ee garden, and (e) secondary forest followed by new forest remnant. The measurement during eleven months showed that the mixed-co#ee garden produced the highest sediment yield (1+3.1g\/m,), and the lowest sediment yield was derived from secondary forest area (*.*2g\/m,). The sediment yield from clean-weeded co#ee system was around 3-..�,13.1 g\/m,, and multistrata system indicated a low sediment yield (,.- g\/m). Although mixed-co#ee garden  showed a very high yield of sediment, natural vegetative strips entrapped 33.1� of the sediment. The vegetative ﬁlter zone covered with grass (+.\/ m long) and short shrubs (- m in length) could entrap 3-.\/� and 33.1� of sediment respectively, and the long shrub ﬁlter (+, m in length) could entrap only \/,.\/� of the sediment due to the concentrated ﬂow in the longer slope. The surface cover condition of the land use system and farming activities\r\n(weeding, tillage, fertilizer application) indicated a high contribution on sediment yield than the other erosion factor.\r\n\r\n,",

Berdasarkan ragam fungsinya, kawasan pesisir merupakan suatu tempat berlangsungnya berbagai jenis kegiatan manusia. Berbagai kegiatan tersebut sccara bersama-sama menggunakan kawasan pesisir sebagai pusat pengembangan dan peningkatan pemanfaatan potensi sumberdaya alam melalui berbagai sektor pembangunan, yang diharapkan dapat meningkatkan kontribusinya dalam pembangunan nasional. Peranan wilayah pesisir dalam kegiatan perekonomian ini dibuktikan oleh adanya pemanfaatan dan pembangunan yang berfungsi ganda. Disatu sisi, wilayah pesisir antara lain mempunyai potensi sunberdaya laut.sarana transportasi laut ( pelabuhan laui). pariwisata dan rekreasi.

In the case of vermiculite, NH+4 was nearly indistinguishable from the nonpreference isotherm while HIV exhibited preference for NH +4suppressing impact on the apparent NH. The presence of K+-Ca2+ exchange had significant selectivity in NH change in HIV most likely because of retardation of Ca- the interlayer. For vermiculite, the presence of K system induced apparent high affinity sites for NH+4-Ca2+ ex-diffusion in the NH+4-Ca most likely because of interlayer collapse. The overall study demonstrated that cation-exchange selectivity coefficients in vermiculite and HIV are dependent on number and type of cations present",

A larger number of RFLP bands was obtained from the bacterial communities in the floodwater and that associated with Cyclopoida than from the bacterial community associated with the other host organisms. The bacterial community associated with Tanycypris gave the smallest number of bands compared with the other habitats. DNA fragments common to Tanycypris, Cladocera, Cyclopoida, and Diptera and specific to the respective organisms were recognized. The RFLP pattern of the bacterial communities in the floodwater was markedly different from and more complex than those from aquatic organisms. The RFLP pattern of the bacterial community associated with Lemna roots was also specific. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis enabled to clearly separate the RFLP patterns of the bacterial communities associated with aquatic organisms from one another. The effect of sampling time on the bacterial communities was not appreciable compared to the effect of host organisms.",

      "abstract": "EVALUATION OF SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF SOIL AND LEAF TISSUE NUTRIENT STATUS AND YIELD (FRESH FRUIT BUNCH) \r\nIN AN OIL PALM PLANTATION\r\n\r\nBy\r\nTAMALUDDIN SYAM\r\n\r\nNovember 2002\r\n\r\n\r\nChairman:  Major Professor Dr. Kamaruzaman Jusoff\r\nFaculty:       Faculty of Forestry\r\n \r\nThe study was carried out at Dusun Durian Estate, Golden Hope Plantations Berhad Banting, Selangor, in a 50 ha plot which represents a coastal oil palm plantation.  The general objective of this study was to obtain accurate and timely information about the spatial distribution and status of nutrients in the soil and leaf tissue using Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing technology for precision farming of oil palm plantation.  Collection of soil and leaf tissue data were conducted by using systematic sampling and an Omni Star DGPS was used to precisely determine the sample sites location.  Geostatistics (GS+) software and classical statistics were used for data analysis.  A SPOT image of K-J.299344 acquired on March 2000 from the Malaysian Centre for Remote Sensing (MACRES) was analysed using a PCI software version 7.0.  Descriptive statistical analysis classed the status of total N as low, whereas available P and exchangeable K varied from moderate to high.  Soil exchangeable Ca and Mg ranged from low to moderate.  Soil nutrients variability of available P, exchangeable K, Ca and Mg status were classified as high and moderate for total N.  Semivariance analysis showed that the total N, available P and exchangeable K in the soil have a moderately spatial dependence and while strongly spatial dependence for exchangeable Ca and Mg with available lag distance of 52 to 117 m.  Leaf nutrient analysis illustrated that the leaf nutrient variability of N, P, and K could be classified as low (CV values of 7, 8 and 12) and moderate variability for Ca and Mg (CV values of 19 and 22).  Based on the semivariance analysis, all the leaf nutrients have a moderately spatial dependence with the lag distances of 75, 75, 51, 63 and 117 m for N, P, K, Ca and Mg, respectively.  There was no strong relationship between nutrient content in the soil and nutrient content in leaf tissue; therefore nutrient content analysis in leaf tissue was not able to predict nutrient content in the soil.  Yield of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) has a high variability and moderately spatial dependence within the lag distance of 84 m.  Both the soil nutrient and nutrient content in leaf tissue were not able to predict FFB, because the statistical analysis indicated that there were no strong relationships between yield FFB and nutrients in soil and leaf tissue.  SPOT image analysis using Digital Numbers (DN), unsupervised and supervised classifications methods could not be used to predict nutrient content in leaf tissue",

      "abstract": "We investigated the impact of land-use changes on the soil biomass at several soil sites in\r\nIndonesia under different types of land-use (primary forest, secondary forest, coffee plan­\r\ntation, traditional orchard, and deforested area), located within a small geographical area\r\nwith similar parent material and climatic conditions. Various parameters of soil microbial\r\nbiomass (biomass C, biomass N, content of anthrone-reactive carbohydrate carbon, and soil \r\nergosterol content) were examined. Our results suggested that the removal of the natural \r\nplant cover did not cause any appreciable decrease in the amount of microbial biomass; on\r\nthe contrary it led to a short-time increase in the amount of microbial biomass which may\r\nbe due to the availability of readily decomposable dead roots and higher sensitivity to the\r\ndecomposition of residual litter in recently deforested soils. However, the amount of micro­\r\nbial biomass tended to decrease in proportion to the duration of the land history in coffee plantation soils. This may be ascribed to the effect of the loss of available substrates asso­ciated with soil erosion in the long term. Lower ergosterol contents in recently deforested areas reflected a reduction in the amount of fungal biomass which may be due to the destruction of the hyphal network by the slash and burn practice. On the other hand, the higher soil ergosterol content at the sites under bush regrowth indicated that microbial biomass was able to recover rapidly with the occurrence of a new plant cover",
