      "abstract": "An experiment was aimed to study the effect of waste water of crude palm oil (CPO) factory on some nutrient available in soil and nutrient content in palm oil. The experiment was conducted using a completely randomized block design with six levels of waste water treatments (0, 250, 500, 750, 1.000, and 1.250 l tree-1 palm oil) in three replications. The result showed that the level 750 l tree-1 of waste water treatment have significant effects on increased of nutrient available in soil (N, P, K, Ca, and Mg) including soil pH, but not significant with level 1.000 and 1.250 l tree-1 except P. On the other hand, nutrient content in palm oil (N, P, and K)were not significantly influenced by waste water treatments.",

      "abstract": "Land degradation is a serious problem in the Upper Sekampung Watersheds.  This is because the farmers cultivated in steep land to coffee crops without  in adequate soil and water conservation practices.   The land degradation is mostly caused by erosion.  The erosion problem not only stripping the most fertile top soil and decreasing crop production, but also resulting problems in lowland.  Therefore, the reorientation land management should be improved to produce agriculture sustainability. The first step is to evaluated land capability this area.  The objectives of the research were evaluate land capability of Upper Sekampung Watersheds.  The results showed that the Upper Sekampung Watersheds were dominated with class and subclass land capability of III-l2 about 17.630,51 ha (41,58 %). All of the constrain for each land capability in this area is erosion hazard, especially land slope.  From this research, cultivated land to coffee base crops were allowed in land capability II-l1.e1, III-l2, IV-l3, and VI-l4, with in adequate soil and water conservation practices. In contrary, the land capability of VII-l5 unsuitable for agriculture, they should be a nature or for conservation forest.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of organic mulching on soil temperature and moisture content. An experiment was conducted in a pineapple plantation at Lampung province, Indonesia from July 2001 to September 2002 using tapioca wastes and rice husk. There were 5 treatments namely: control\/no mulch, rice husk mulch, cassava bagasse mulch, cassava peel mulch, and black polyethylene film mulch. The results showed that the soil temperatures of the surface layers under cassava bagasse and black polyethylene film mulches slightly increased with the increase in air temperature, while rice husk and cassava peel mulches decreased the heat convection into soil surface by retaining the incoming solar radiation heat within mulches layers. However, soil temperature regimes were greatly ameliorated by the mulching materials and that enhanced water absorption by pineapple, therefore the total wet biomasses and yields were improved. Cassava bagasse mulch enhanced effective rainfall during rainy season, better than the other mulching materials.",

The continued application of  bokashi for 4 years significantly increased the total\r\npopulation of protozoa and algae, however, the  significantly effect was obtained in the population of Volvox only. The population of protozoa and algae were affected by the time of flooding of paddy fields where it increases exponentially at the 20 and 30 days after flooding and stable after that, ecxept for Euglena where it increases sligthly\r\nby flooding time.",

      "abstract": "The microbial biomass carbon of soil is being increasingly recognized as a sensitive indicator of soil quality. Its knowledge is fundamental for sustainable environmental management. This study aimed to determine the impact of organic and chemical fertilizers and their combination on soil microbial biomass carbon, maize yield and the relationship between soil microbial biomass carbon, maize yield and some chemicals properties of soil using the chlorofrom lumigation extraction method. For this purpose, a total of 8 treatments with triplication were conducted, such as control, 100% chicken manure, 100% Gliricidia sp. leaf, 100% chemical fertilizers (CF), 50% chicken manure + 50% CF, 50% Gliricidia sp. leaf + 50% CF, 75% chicken manure + 25% CF 50% Gliricidia sp. leaf + 50% CF. One-Way ANOVA showed a significant difference in biomass C-mic and maize yield between treatments. Organic and chemical fertilizers treatment signitificant higher in biomass C-mic and maize yield cumpare with control. The treatments of chicken manure were shown to be signilicantly higher than the others and better in C-mic value compare Gliricidia sp. leaf'. The biomass C-mic and maize yield correlated to the chemical propcrtics of the soil, such as organic C, total N, and pH. Present study clearly shows that chicken manure is better amended ultisols soils.",

The rizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil of maize was setup in the special pots with dimension of 60 cm x 60 cm x 30 cm in the glasshouse.  The Ultisols soil was planted with maize until the vegetative stages. The results showed that  on the distance of  > 20 cm from center of roots, the age of maize increase the population of phosphate solubilizing microorganisms.  The population of phosphate solubilizing microorganisms in the rhizosphere soil was 8 - 23× more than from those non-rhizosphere soils. On the distance of 0-10 cm, the age of maize affected the number of phosphate solubilizing microorganisms in the rizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil. Available-P (Bray I) was affected by the age and distance of root maize.  The highest value was observed on the 7 weeks after planting at a distance of >20 cm.  Available P was significantly higher in the rhizosphere soil than that in non-rhizosphere soil, especially at a distance of >20 cm on the 7 weeks after planting.  The positive correlation was occurred between phosphate solubilizing microorganism and the value of available-P, soil pH, organic C and total N.",

This study is the third step from a series of studies aim to develop bioassay\r\ntechnique to detect the present and quantity of herbicides in soil and water.  In this study, bioassay was used to detect movement of paraquat and 2,4-D herbicides in soil.  Study was carried out using soil column method. \r\n Treatments were arranged factorially in a completely randomized block design with 3 replicates.  Two ultisol so\r\nil types: Podsolik Merah Kuning (PMK) and Latosol Coklat (LC) and 2 post emergence herbicides: paraquat and 2,4-D, were tested. To calculate the amount of herbicide using bioassay, each standard curve for paraquat and 2,4-D were\r\n developed. Using these standard curves, the amount of paraquat and 2,4-D was calculated based on the growth rat\r\ne of caisim as indicator plant.  Results showed that bioassay method can be utilized to detect herbicide movement in soil.  The amount and the rate of herbicide movement were determined by soil and herbicide types.  In PMK, paraquat reached the depth of 20-30 cm at 2 weeks after application (WAA), however, after that the amount of paraquat  found was very limited.  In LC, the movement of paraquat was more limited compared to its movement in PMK.  Paraquat reached soil depth of 10-20 cm at 2 WAA, afterward paraquat was only detected in soil depth of 0-10 cm.  Sim\r\nilar pattern was observed for 2,4-D which reached soil depth of 30-40 cm at 1 WAA in PMK.  In LC, 2,4-D movement was more limited.  At 2 WAA, 2,4-D in LC reached soil depth of 30-40 cm in limited amount and after 12 WAA th\r\ne herbicide was detected only at soil depth of 0-10 cm",

      "abstract": "The dynamics of earthworm populations were investigated in continuosly cropped, Conventional egroecosystem which had received annual long-term (4 years) amendments of either manure or inorganic fertilizer. The system had an identical 4-year crop rotation and differed essentially only in the amount and type of fertilizer supplied' Experiment was set up at Taman Bogo, in the vicinity of Purbolinggo, East Lampung. The eight farming systems differed mainly in fertilization application. The organic systems were fertilized exclusively with chicken manure (CK), and green manure Glyricidium sp' (GM) 20 ton ha-,. One conventionel systems was fertilized with the in organic fertilizers (IF) urea 300 kg ha-, Sp 36 200 kg ha, and KCI 100 kg ha -') Four proportion ccmbination fertilizctl organic  and inorganic fertilizers i.e combination of 50% CK+50% IF 50% GM + 50% Lf, 75% CK+25% IF,and 75% GM +25% IF. Treatment received neither fertilizer and Pesticides was served as a control. Earthworm numbers and biomass were significantly highest in chicken manure,amended plots compare to inorganic fertilizers treated plots",
