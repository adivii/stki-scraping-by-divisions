It is possible because industrial waste contains nutrients needed by plants.  The use of industrial waste for fertilizers is by adding lime and\/or peat.  This research was to study the effect of several fertilizer formulas composed of metal-spoon industrial waste, lime, and peat on the availabilities of macro and micronutrients in Ultisol from Sungkai Utara Lampung.  The results showed that the treatments (1) increased the soil pH (2) increased the exchangeable-K, available-Cu, available-Zn, and (3) decreased the available-P, available-Fe, and available-Mn.",

The plots were as follows: plot without cover weed (control plot), plot covered with Paspalum conjugatum, and plot covered with the natural vegetation (5 m wide and 20 m long) along a 15\" slope. Soil samples were collected from 0 to 20 and 20 to 40 em depths. The activities of acid phosphatase and .a-glucosidase were in general higher in the plots covered with P. conjugatum and the natural vegetation. The content of available P was well correlated with the activities of acid phosphatase, .Î±-glucosidase, and arylsulfatase. The decrease in the activities of the soil enzymes in the control plot relative to the plots with plant cover was attributed to a higher degree of soil erosion in the control plot than in the plots with plant cover",

      "abstract": "To understand the effect of land use changes on the composition of humus in tropical soils, samples from land under primary forest, secondary forest, coffee plantation, and arable crops were investigated at three sites in south Sumatra, Indonesia. Total carbon and total nitrogen contents were 1.7 to 4.3 times and 1.1 to 2.8 times greater in the topsoil under primary forest than under the other types of land use. Following change from primary forest to other uses, the proportion of humic acids in the organic matter of the topsoils decreased while that of the fulvic acid fraction increased. Within the range of land uses, differences in the yields of humic acids and fulvic acid fractions were, respectively, larger and smaller than those in total carbon content. The humic acids were classiÂ®ed into the low and middle classes in the degree of humiÂ®cation. Absorption due to the green fraction of humic acids, Pg, was detected in the Uvvisible spectra of almost all the humic acids. No relation was observed between the degree of humiÂ®cation of humic acids or the strength of Pg absorption in their spectra and land use change. The fulvic acid fractions were fractionated on insoluble polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) into the adsorbed fractions consisting of humic substances and the non-adsorbed fractions consisting of non-humic substances. A positive correlation between the amount of the fulvic acid fraction and the percentage of the PVP-adsorbed fraction within it indicated that the variation in the amount of the fulvic acid fraction was attributable to acid-soluble humic substances. The ionization difference spectra of solutions between pH 12 and pH 7 suggested that the chemical structures of the PVP-adsorbed fulvic acids have been altered by land use change.",
