      "abstract": "The behavior of diuron herbicide in the soils, such as adsorption, is  important to be investigated. An experiment was designed to study the correlation between several soil properties (pH, CEC, organic-C, and soil texture) of seven tropical Lampungese soils and the adsorption of diuron herbicide in soils.  Soils were equilibrated with five levels of concentrations of diuron using a batch technique.  The adsorption was measured based on Freundlich coefficient values (Kf values).  The results showed that the adsorption of diuron herbicide in tropical Lampungese soils were varied depend on soil properties which are the most factors but not significant.  Moreover, the adsorption capacity of diuron herbicide in seven tropical Lampungese soils according to Kf values were as follow: Taman Bogo soil < Hajimena soil  < Cukuh Balak soil < Gisting Atas soil < Sumber Jaya soil < Padang Ratu  soil < Pagetahan soil.  However, there was no correlation between Kf values and soil properties of seven tropical Lampungese soils.",

      "abstract": "Soil microbial activities indicated by soil respiration and soil microbial biomass carbon (C-mik soil) in Ultisols soil as affecting by application of diuron herbicide and long-term fertilizers applications were studied.  A factorial experiment in a Randomized Block Design with two replications was established.  The first factor was dosages of diuron herbicide which are 0 mg kg-1 (without diuron) and 10 mg kg-1 (with diuron). The second factor was  fertilizers applications which are without fertilizer (control), 100% chicken manures (dosage 20 ton ha-1), 100% green manures (leaves of Glyricidium sp., dosage 20 ton ha-1), 100% chemical fertilizers (300 kg Urea ha-1, 200 kg SP-36 ha-1, 100 kg KCl ha-1), combination of 50% chicken manures and 50% chemical fertilizers, and combination of 50% green manures and 50% chemical fertilizers.    After treatments, soils were incubated in a dark room at 25oC.    Soil respiration and C-mik soil were measured at 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after herbicide application (AHA).  The results showed that long-term fertilizers applications increased soil respiration and C-mik soil. A diuron herbicide application did not increase soil respiration and C-mik soil, except at 28 days AHA, soil without herbicide increased C-mik soil.    There was not interaction between herbicide and long-term fertilizers applications in relation to soil respiration and C-mik soil.  It was recommended to use diuron herbicide wisely as it affecting soil microbial activities.",
