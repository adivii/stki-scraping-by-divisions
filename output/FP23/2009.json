      "abstract": "Land degradation is a serious problem in Upper Sekampung watersheds. This is because land use chance and the farmers cultivated coffee based farms on steep land without adequate soil and water conservation technologies. Land degradation caused by erosion was generally greater than the local tolerable soil loss. Erosion on site washed the most fertile top soil, decreased land productivity and in turn declined farmer’s income. Therefore, the land management practices should be improved. This research were to find the erosion in each land unit with universal soil loss equation formula. The results of the research showed that the erosion were obviously affected by land use and slope.  Erosion in upland agriculture land use > 15 % were higher than tolerable soil loss (TSL), thus erosion in shrubs land with slope > 15 % were higher than TSL. Whereas the erosion  in primary or secondary forest in various slope the erosion lower than TSL."

      "abstract": "The research aimed to study the change of population of phosphate solubilizing microorganisms according to the application time of bokashi which were applied continously on organic paddy rice fields since years of 2000 up to 2006. The research was conducted in a Randomized Completely Block Design in four replicates. The treatments were without bokashi (control; with intensively application of NPK fertilizers), bokashi application for 3 planting seasons (12 t ha-1), bokashi application for 4 planting seasons (16 t ha-1), bokashi application for 7 planting seasons (28 t ha-1), and bokashi application for 9 planting seasons (36 t ha-1). The results showed that the population of phosphate solubilizing microorganisms were not affected by continously applied of bokashi and did not have correlations to organic carbon, total nitrogen, ratio C\/N, soil pH, and soil water content. However, the phosphate solubilizing microorganisms had played a role in the availability of the soil available-P which were shown by increasing of paddy yields year by year, although the contribution of soil phosphorus from bokashi is a relatively low. Yet, the bokashi application on the organic paddy fields did not increase the soil availble-P because most of the P which was absorbed by the plants coming from residual P fertilizers either from bokashi or SP-36 which were intensevely given before.",

The effect of liquid waste of oil palm production on the population, biomass, the weight of casting and population and diversity of soil meso fauna was conducted at Oil Palm Plantation of PTPN VII Bekri. The research was conducted with survey methods on the land that amended with oil palm liquid waste and that without palm liquid waste. The results showed that the application of oil palm liquid waste increase the population, biomass of earthworm, the weight of casting as well as the population of soil meso fauna not only in the 0-10 cm and 0-5 cm deep of soil but also in the 0-5 and 5-10 cm, respectively. On the other hand, the diversity indices of earthworm and soil meso fauna were not affected by the application of oil palm liquid waste. The population of earthworm and soil meso fauna was lower in the 10-20 cm and 5-10 cm deep of soil than on the 0-10 and 0-5 cm, respectively on both treatments. Meso fauna was domínate by Acarina both on the land with and without application of liquid waste of oil palm",

The results showed that the application of chicken manure with the dosage of less than 5 Mg ha-1 combined with NPK fertilizer did not effective to affect the increasing of growth and production of chinese mustard. Meanwhile, application of chicken manure more than 5 Mg ha-1 combined with NPK fertilizer was significantly affected the growth, production of chinese mustard and soil properties i.e. total-C, total-N, vailable P , exchangeable K, and humic and fulvic acid. The application of chicken manure effective to reduce NPK fertilizer.  The best yield was found in using 50% of NPK fertilizer  and 50%  of chicken manure (10 Mg ha-1).",

      "abstract": "Oxisols is a heavily weathered soil that has good physical properties for planting perennial species, such as coffee and pepper. However, this soil has low nutrient availability. Way Kanan District in Lampung Province is one of the central of coffee and pepper productions in Indonesia. In this area, the soil type is dominated by Oxisols. Use of compost made from shells of Arabica coffee fruits is one way to improve soil fertility of Oxisols. The study aimed at understanding the effects of application of compost made from shells of coffee fruits to the chemical properties of Oxisols, i.e. pH, organic C content, total N, available P, and exchangeable-Ca, -K, and -Mg. An incubation experiment was conducted using a completely randomized design with four treatments and three replicates. The treatments were dosages of compost made from shells of coffee fruits i.e. 0, 5, 10, and 20 ton ha-1. Each treatment was incubated during 5, 10, and 15 weeks.  The results showed that application of compost made from shells of coffee fruits did not increase organic C content, total N, and available P of Oxisols during different incubation periods (i.e. after 5, 10, and 15 weeks). However, application of the compost significantly increased pH and exchangeable-K, -Ca, and –Mg of Oxisols (P>0.05). The highest pH and exchangeable-K, -Ca, and –Mg were found after application 20 ton ha-1 of compost after 5, 10, and 15 weeks of incubations. The results suggest that application of compost made from shells of Arabica coffee fruits is a potential alternative to improve fertility of Oxisols.",

The experiment were: control (without fertilizer), 20 Mg ha 20 Mg ha-1 ha-1-1  chicken manure (CK)  green manure Glyricidium sp. (GM), 100 %  inorganic fertilizers (IF) (urea 300 kg ha-1, SP 36 200 kg, and KCl 100 kg ha-1 ), 50% CK + 50% IF, 50% GM + 50% IF, 75% CK + 25% IF, and 75% GM + 25% IF.  Soil samples were taken at the first corn growing season (2001) and the eight corn growing season (2004). VAM fungi spores were examined by wet sieving methods.  The results showed that application of chicken manure or its combination with inorganic fertilizers had higher VAM fungi spore. The dominant species of VAM fungi at all treatment was Glomus constrictum.",

The systems had an identical 4–year crops rotation and differed essentially only in the amount and type of fertilizer supplied. Experiment was setup at Taman Bogo, in the vicinity of Probolinggo, East Lampung. The eight farming systems differed mainly in fertilization application. The organic systems were fertilized exclusively with chicken manure (CK), and green manure Glyricidium sp. (GM) 20 Mg ha-1. One conventional system was fertilized with the inorganic fertilizers (IF) (urea 300 kg ha-1, SP 36 200 kg ha-1, and KCl 100 kg ha-1).  Four proportion combination fertilized organic and inorganic fertilizers i.e combination of 50% CK + 50% IF, 50% GM + 50% IF, 75% CK + 25% IF, and 75% GM + 25% IF.  Application of chicken manure both exclusively or combination with inorganic fertilizer gave the higher AMF spore number and root colonization than others treatment. The dominant species of AMF at all treatment was Glomus constrictum."
