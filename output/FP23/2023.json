      "abstract": "Ultisol soil has a low organic matter content, CEC, and pH, causing an insufficient buffering capacity for N nutrients, especially NH4+. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of tillage and fertilization on the quantity and intensity (Q\/I) of Ammonium (CRNH40, PBCNH4+, NH40, KG) in the soil, plant N and C uptake, and mung bean yields at the sixth growing season in ultisols. This study was arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial in a Randomized Block Design (RBD). The first factor was the tillage system (T), namely minimum tillage (T0) and intensive tillage (T1). The second factor was the fertilization (P), namely without fertilizer application (P0), and with fertilizer application (NPK 200 kg ha-1 + 1 Mg ha-1 chicken manure) (P1). Each treatment was replicated four times. The results showed that the application of NPK fertilizer significantly affected the mung bean yield, mung bean plant Nitrogen and Carbon uptake at harvest time. While, the intensive tillage had a very significant effect on increasing the N uptake compared to the minimum tillage. Minimum tillage and fertilization increased Q\/I parameters (PBCNH4+, KG, CRNH40, and NH40). The parameter of Q\/I (CRNH40) was significantly correlated with mung bean plant N and C uptake. PBCNH4+ and KG were significantly correlated with mung bean yields.",

This research was to study the phytoremediation potential of several plants in heavy-metal polluted tropical soils.  Soil samples were collected from experimental plots amended in 1998 with 0, 15, and 60 Mg industrial waste ha-1.  The soil samples were planted in a glass-house experiment with 3 different plants i.e caisim (Brassica chinensis var. Parachinensis), water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica), and lettuce (Lactuca sativa).   Plant parts (roots and shoots) and soil samples were harvested after a 4-week growth period and analyzed for Zn.  The results show that the growth of plants was depressed by the increase in the soil Zn as affected by waste treatment, with water spinach being the most progressive and producing the greatest biomass.  All plants significantly decreased the concentration of Zn in soils, with water spinach decreased the most significantly.  The absorption of Zn increased with the soil Zn (high linear R2).  Zinc was accumulated greater in plant roots than that in shoots.  All plants were good Zn phytostabilizators.",

      "abstract": "In tropical soils, phosphorus (P) adsorption is one of the main processes that control the availability of P for\r\nplant growth. Soils that develop from volcanic material have a high P uptake as the mineral composition contains a lot of\r\nactive colloids of Fe and Al which play a crucial role to adsorb P in soil complex. Soils which have a high capacity of P\r\nadsorption, potentially decrease the efficiency of P fertilizers into the soil as it is unavailable for plant growth. Langmuir\r\nIsothermic Model is a mathematical model that can be used to determine the capacity adsorption (Xmax) and the relative\r\nenergy (K L) of phosphorus in the soil. This study was therefore aimed to obtain the information on the maximum\r\nphosphorus absorption capacity in the soil samples of Tufa Ranau Geological Formation (TRGF). The basic information\r\nfrom this research provided the valuable information of P nutrients management in the soil to support the efficiency of P\r\nfertilizer and food security. Soil samples were collected from TRGF area at three zones in West Lampung Regency (1. ±\r\n40 km; 2. ± 30 km; and 3. ± 20 km in the southern area of Lake Ranau). Soil samples were collected from two deph of\r\nsoils (0 – 20 cm and 20 – 40 cm). This research was an experimental study that has been conducted in the Laboratory of\r\nSoil Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Lampung to analysis the behavior of P adsorption with Langmuir\r\nIsothermic Model. Then the Student-t test was performed to see the difference between the maximum absorption of\r\nphosphorus and the relative energy of phosphorus adsorption in each treatment. The results showed that soil in Balik Bukit\r\nhas a maximum adsorption P value (Xmax) which is higher than that of the soil in Sekincau and Batu Brak on TRGF. The\r\nhigh value of X max is because Balik Bukit may have to do with a high Fe content of 35.95 mg kg-1, since Fe is one of the\r\ncauses of high P sorption in the soil. The relative energy of phosphorus adsorption value (K L) in subsurface horizons is\r\nrelatively higher than that of in surface horizon so that P in subsurface horizons is relatively difficult to be available when\r\ncompared to surface horizons, because the higher K L value makes P more difficult to be available to plants.",

Soil erodibility is ranging 0.007-0.080 was categorized low to very low due to the amount of sand and silt is too low. The Slope also categorized low around 1-4%. The crop factor value is around 0.01-1. The rate of erosion in pineapple was 2016 is 1.51 ton\/ha\/year until 15 ton\/ha\/year; that value is under standard permissible erosion (18.5-25 ton\/ha\/year).",

This research was to investigate the effects of several tropical weeds on the available K in two tropical soils with distinct properties.  Five potential weeds including Asystacia gangetica, Arachis pintoi, Widelia sp., Paspalum conjugatum and Pennisetum purpureum were grown in the soil samples contained in polybags.  The soil available K was depleted by weeds except in soils planted with A. pintoi as indicated by the positive values of the change in the available K after two monthss growing period, suggesting that A. Pintoi root was more effective than the other four weeds in enhancing the soil available K.  The effectiveness of weeds in enhancing the soil available K were: A. Pintoi > A. gangetica > Widelia sp. > P. conjugatum > P. purpureum.",

This research was to study the effects of liming and phytoextraction by land spinach in lowering the soil concentrations of Cu and Zn in heavy-metal contaminated tropical soils. Soil samples collected from a 22-years-old experimental field one- time amended with heavy-metal-containing waste at 0-60 Mg ha−1 were treated with lime at 0-5 Mg ha−1 and planted with land spinach in a glass-house experiment. After 4 weeks the soil and plant Cu and Zn were analyzed. The results show that the 60 Mg waste ha−1 significantly increased the soil concentrations of Cu and Zn and depressed the land spinach growth. Land spinach slightly lowered the soil concentrations of Cu and Zn in unlimed soils at waste levels ≤15 Mg ha−1. Liming significantly lowered the soil concentrations of Cu and Zn and improved the growth and Cu-Zn uptake of land spinach but attenuated the effect of land spinach in decreasing the soil concentrations of Cu and Zn. The Cu-Zn uptake of land spinach was well-correlated with the soil concentrations of Cu and Zn.",

This research was to evaluate the growth of corn (Zea mays L.) in a biochar-amended heavy-metal-contaminated tropical soil. Soil samples were collected from well-maintained experimental plots 22 years after amendment with heavy-metal containing industrial waste at 0 – 60 Mg ha-1. Corn plants were grown for 4 weeks in the soil samples amended with biochar at 0 – 10 Mg ha-1. The corn plant height and dry masses (roots, shoots, and the whole plants) were lowered by waste in relation to the increase in the soil Cu and Zn concentrations. The corn plant dry–weight masses (roots, shoots, whole plant) were well and negatively correlated with the soil Cu and Zn concentrations. The corn plant uptake of Cu and Zn decreased with the increase in the soil Cu and Zn concentration. Biochar improved the corn plant height and dry-weight masses, related to the decrease in the soil Cu and Zn concentrations. Biochar also increased the Zn uptake at waste level of ≥ 15 Mg ha-1 and increased the Cu uptake at waste level ≤ 15 Mg ha-1. The corn plant Cu uptake was linearly and positively correlated with plant dry-weight masses of roots, shoot, and whole plant masses.",

      "abstract": "Salah satu bentuk penyebaran pengetahuan (transfer of knowledge) dalam upaya menggalakkan pertanian yang berwawasan lingkungan dan berkelanjutan adalah melalui kegiatan uji tanah sawah untuk menentukan rekomendasi pemupukan yang berimbang bagi lahan pertanaman padi sawah. Uji tanah sawah dengan menggunakan Perangkat Uji Tanah Sawah (paddy soil test kit) dan analisis sampel tanah telah dilakuan di Desa Wonodadi Utara, Kecamatan Gading Rejo, Kabupaten Pringsewu, Lampung untuk menentukan status kandungan unsur hara N, P, K dan rekomendasi pemupukan N, P, K pada tanah sawah tersebut. Selain melakukan uji dan analisis tanah, penyuluhan penggunaan bahan organik yang berasal dari limbah pertanian lokal, seperti jerami padi, sekam dan kotoran hewan ternak sebagai sumber pupuk organik bagi tanah sawah juga dilakukan agar kebutuhan unsur hara lain selain N, P, K dapat terpenuhi bagi tanaman padi. Hasil analisis tanah menunjukkan bahwa status kandungan hara N pada sampel tanah sawah sangat rendah dan rendah, kandungan hara P sangat rendah dan rendah dan kandungan hara K rendah. Dosis pupuk yang direkomendasikan berdasarkan status hara tanah tersebut adalah 240 kg NPK Phonska\/ha + 172 kg Urea\/ha + 40 kg KCl\/ha atau setara dengan 43,2 kg NPK Phonska + 30,96 kg Urea + 7,2 kg KCl untuk luasan lahan 1800 m2 atau per petak lahan sawah. Petani dapat mengganti pupuk KCl dengan kompos jerami padi karena kandungan K yang tinggi pada jerami padi. Petani sangat dianjurkan mengaplikasikan pupuk organik dalam bentuk kompos jerami padi karena selama ini petani hanya mengaplikasikan pupuk anorganik.",

This research was to study the growth and phytoextraction behaviors of elephant grass\r\nin soil amended with industrial waste. Soil samples were obtained from an experimental field\r\ntreated with a heavy metal containing waste at 0, 15 and 60 Mg ha-1, CaCO3 at 0 and 5 Mg ha-1,\r\nand compost at 0 and 5 Mg ha-1. Soil samples were planted with elephant grass, 8 weeks after\r\nwhich the soil samples were analyzed for Cu and Zn. Plant roots and shoots were harvested\r\nand weighed for their dry-masses and analyzed for Cu and Zn. The results demonstrate that the\r\nRoot\/Shoot increased and show good correlations with the increase in soil Cu or Zn. The plant\r\nCu or Zn increased with the increase in soil Cu or Zn but decreased with liming. Plant Cu and\r\nZn in roots and the whole plants as well as their TFs were well correlated with soil Cu and Zn.\r\nThese observations confirm that the root\/shoot growth and Cu and Zn absorption by elephant\r\ngrass are governed by soil Cu and Zn and elephant grass is a Cu and Zn phytoextractor",
