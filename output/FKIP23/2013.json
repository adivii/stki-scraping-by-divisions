Therefore, this research is intended to construct a teaching and learning model of practical teaching that can improve pedagogical competence as the ultimate goal to be achieved by future teacher candidates. The main subjects of this study were\r\nundergraduate students of the Elementary School Teacher Education program conducting their PPL in Indonesia University of Education and Lampung University. Based on the analysis of Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, on the level of significance of 95% (α = 0,05), the model produced from the\r\nresearch and development process and called the Model Pembelajaran Praktik Mengajar Reflektif (MP2MR) was verified to help improve students competence based on the following benefits,(a) teaching and learning and evaluation designs\r\nfocused on standardized achievements (b) individual and contextual implementation of problem-solving based process of teaching and learning, and (c)",
