      "abstract": "ABSTRACT :\r\nBackground : Sexually  transmitted  infections (STI) is one  of the health problem in all over  the world, not only in modern country but also in developing  country. Sexual  intercourse in extramarital also cause the increasing of  the incidence of Sexually Transmitted Infections. The etiology of Sexually Transmitted Infections is organism such as bacteria, viral, fungi, and ectoparasite. There was no reported about  the incidence of Sexually Transmitted Infections  in Dr.Abdul Moeloek Hospital Lampung. \r\nAim of Study : To know the pattern of Sexually Transmitted Infections  in Dr.H.Abdul Moeloek Hospital.                              Method : A retrospective study by evaluating  patient medical record who outpatient in Dermatovenereology Department of Dr.H.Abdul Moeloek  Hospital during January 2, 2008 untill December 31, 2009.                                                                   Result :  The  number of  Sexually  Transmitted  Infections (STI) was found in  Department  of Dermatovenereology  Dr.H.Abdul Moeloek Hospital Lampung  during January 02, 2008 until December 31, 2009 were  278 (2,35 %). The incidence of STI in male is higher than female  (1,6 : 1). The youngest  patient was 14 years old and the oldest was 62 years old,and  the most  predominat  age were in  the group of 25 - 44 years (42 %), The distribution of the STI were : Non Specific  Urethritis  (28,8%),  Gonorrhea (22,6%), Condiloma Acuminata (22,3%), Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (19,8%), Bartholinitis (3,6%) and Herpes Genitalis  (2,9%).                                                                                                                 Conclusion : During January 2, 2008 until December 31, 2009 we found 278 patient (2,35%),  male higher than female (1,6 ;  1), with the highest pattern of STI is Non spesific urethritis (28,8 %).\r\nKey words :  sexually transmitted infections, pattern of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is caused by a narrowing of coronary artery’s lumen as\r\na result of atherosclerosis process on the vessel wall that cause diminished blood flow and oxygen\r\nsupply to myocardium. On its course, CHD can be progressive and sudden changes from stable\r\nto acute condition known as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) often occurred. The sudden changes\r\nwere associated with acute thrombosis on the eroded, cracked or ruptured atherosclerotic plaque.\r\nPlaque rupture is associated with the change a stable plaque to labile and vulnerable plaque.\r\nCurrent laboratory studies also aimed for an early detection of plaque changes before the rupture\r\nof atherosclerotic plaque. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) is a novel plaque\r\ndestabilization marker that can be detected before the rupture of plaque, ischemia, infarct or\r\nnecrosis myocardium. Lp-PLA2 also reported as an endothelial dysfunction marker which is the\r\nearly phase of atherosclerosis and used in risk stratification of ACS. Lp-PLA2 is produced by\r\nmacrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells. The enzyme hydrolyzes oxLDL and produces\r\nlysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) and oxidized fatty acid (oxFA). LysoPC and oxFA cause endothelial\r\ndysfunction and induce white muscle cells and macrophages apoptosis which in turn lead to\r\nnecrotic core broadening in the atherosclerotic plaque, thinning of fibrous cap, and plaque destabilization\r\nwhich then can cause plaque rupture. Laboratory tests for Lp-PLA2 can be performed\r\nby means of mass or enzyme activity measurement i.e. ELISA for Lp-PLA2 mass measurement as\r\nwell as photometric or radioimmunoassay for activity measurement. Lp-PLA2 mass measurement\r\nreported to be more precise and accurate as a marker of CHD risk compared to the enzyme\r\nactivity measurement.\r\nKeywords: Coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, Lp-PLA2, LysoPC.",
