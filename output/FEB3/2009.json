This study aims to determine the effect that occurs between Leverage, Asymmetric Information and Corporate Governance on the Firm Value through Cash Holdings as a mediating variable. The data used in this study are published financial report from 33 manufacturing companies in the Consumer Goods Industry Sector listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2011 - 2017. The conclusion of this study is that cash holdings are only able to mediate the influence of corporate governance with a proxy proportion of the board independence on firm value. Directly cash holding and corporate governance with a proxy proportion of the number of independent commissioners also influence the firm value while leverage, asymmetric information and corporate governance with a proxy percentage of the number of share ownership by managerial does not directly affect the firm value of the company. So as to increase the value of the company, companies should determine the proportion of the right amount of board independence so it can create a good corporate government that can increase value of the company.\r\nKeywords:\r\nFirm Value, Leverage, Asymmetric Information, Corporate Governance, Cash Holdings",
