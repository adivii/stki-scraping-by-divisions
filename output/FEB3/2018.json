In 2007 chosen as the cut-off year of observation as we find in each country\r\nwas issued a significant environmental policy. By doing a differential test on a sample of 24.626 independent\r\nfirms\/years, the study found that four variables used in this study overall showed a significant difference.\r\nEnvironmental costs, the disclosure of environmental, social disclosure, and ESG that observed in three\r\ndeveloping countries has increased significantly after 2007. However, we did not find a significant increase\r\nin environmental costs in Indonesia. The findings of this study indicate that the theory of regulation,\r\nparticularly for public interest theory, can explain clearly the reasons why the four variables research has\r\nincreased after the environmental regulations issued.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Environmental accounting, accounting and social disclosure, developing countries, regulation.",

The research population was 570 traditional fishery workers (pemindangan, salting, fumigation and fermentation). The number of research samples was calculated by Slovin formula and obtained as many as 235 respondents. The number of respondents for each business unit was determined using proportional random sampling technique. Technical analysis of data using SPSS was multiple linear regression analysis. The variables in this research were motivation (X1) technical competence (X2), managerial competence (X3), social competence (X4), Performance of processor (Y). Field data were collected in July-September 2017. The results of this research were (1) Performance of processor when viewed from good profit perspective, especially in East Lampung, whereas in Kabupaten Tanggamus and Pringsewu still low, if seen from aspect of quality and work behavior worker in the three districts are good. Processing performance in Lampung Province seen from the aspect of profit was influenced by motivation and technical competence, quality and work behavior influenced by motivation, technical competence and social competence.",
