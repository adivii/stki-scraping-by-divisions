The concepts of \r\nrelationship marketing and marketing theory of ethics underpin the relationship among variables. This study \r\nadopted a quantitative approach through a survey of 460 respondents from 13 company services and \r\nmanufacturers. Internal marketing variables were measured at the unit level and tested using interrater \r\nagreement and the intraclass correlation. In contrast, the cognitive moral variables, behavioural \r\nperformance, and sales force performance results were measured individually. Hierarchical linear modelling \r\n(HLM) was used to test the effect of the cross-level research variables. The results showed that internal \r\nmarketing empirically supports cognitive morals. However, the effect of internal marketing does not support \r\nthe two-dimensional performances of the sales force. Theoretically, the contributions, internal marketing \r\nand cognitive morals have shown the relationship between marketing and marketing theory of ethics",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT\r\nThe study aims to determine the effect of risk management that is proxied by operational risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk on financial performance in BPRS in Indonesia. The approach used a quantitative approach. This type of research was explanatory research that explained the causal relationship between the independent variables toward the dependent variable. This study used secondary data types taken from Islamic banks, especially the Islamic Rural Bank (BPRS) in Indonesia. This study's variables included independent risk management variables as measured by NPF and operational risk with BOPO. At the same time, the dependent variable was measured by ROA. The results showed that risk management proxied by financing risk or NPF and operational risk (BOPO) had a significant effect on financial performance. NPF had a significant negative effect on financial performance (ROA). BOPO had a significant effect on financial performance (ROA).\r\n\r\nKeywords: risk management, operational risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and financial performance, Islamic rural banks",
