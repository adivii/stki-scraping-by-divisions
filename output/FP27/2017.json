Twelve rabbits were immunized against ovPG DEAE-TrisHCl (DT),DEAE-NaCl 20mM (DN2), DEAE-NaCl 40mM (DN4), DEAE-NaCl 80mM (DN8), DEAE-NaCl160mM (DN16), DEAE-NaCl 320mM (DN32) and DEAE-NaCl 1M (DN1) and NaCl 0.9 % as aplacebo. The 0.5 ml of isolate (purified from ovine cotyledon) was emulsified in equal volume withcomplete and incomplete Freud's adjuvant. The mixture of each isolate and adjuvant was injected atmutiple sites along the dorsal area of rabbits by subcutaneous route. Blood were collected from marginalear vein, starting before first injection (baseline) and every 14 days. Rabbit anti-ovPAG were measuredusing Modified ELISA Technique. By using Western Blot Technique, DN32 showed the best immuneresponse among others and also could differenciate ovPAG in the urine of pregnant ewes It could beconcluded that ovPAG DN32 is a specific source of rabbit anti-ovPAG production. Protein of ovPAG atmolecular weight 31 kDa is a pregnancy protein marker of garut sheep and could be developed as amajor protein for producing antibodi.",

Materials used in this research are the seeds of avocado, jackfruit seeds, and seeds of durian. The material obtained from the three traditional markets, namely Bandar Lampung Bambu Kuning, Markets Teluk, and Market Way Halim. This research was conducted using a survey method with the sampling design. Samples were taken three replications from each market using purposive random sampling.  The results showed that: (1) the moisture content of 81.28% jackfruit seeds, avocado seed 60.16%, and 45.95% durian seeds (2) The lipid content of crude oil in the avocado seed 11: 40%, 10 durian seeds, 98%, and jackfruit seeds 10: 25% (3) the protein content in seeds 11.70% jackfruit, durian 6: 56% of fruit seeds, and avocado seed 6: 52%.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Avocado Seeds,Seeds of Jackfruit, Durian Fruit Seeds",
