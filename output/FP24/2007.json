In the coffee\r\nplantations, Verticillium colonies often develop on the uredium and urediospores of H. vastatrix causing coffee leaf rust.\r\nThe objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of V. lecanii to prevent disease incidence on coffee leaf disks in\r\nthe laboratory. Leaf samples showing lesions with H. vastatrix uredospores and whitish mycelium expected to be\r\nVerticillium were taken from two coffee fields at Sumberjaya Subdistrict, West Lampung, and transported in ice chest to the\r\nlaboratory. Verticillium was isolated with a sterilized needle and grown on PDA-lactic acid media (PDA-L). Verticillium\r\nwas identified as V. lecanii as reported previously. In the first test, each of two isolates of V. lecanii was grown on media\r\ncontaining yeast extract, malt, peptone-water, and dexytrose (YMPD) to produce conidia. In the second and third tests,\r\neach of five antagonistic isolates was grown on PDA-L. Suspension with 107 conidia ml-1 was sprayed into leaf disks and\r\nthen the disks were inoculated with urediospores (104 ml-1). In the first test, disease incidence was significantly reduced.\r\nHowever, in the second and third tests, the disease was not significantly reduced.\r\n\r\nKey words: Verticillium lecanii, Hemileia vastatrix, coffee leaf rust, mycoparasitism",

      "abstract": "Golf course is a unique ecosystem where plant parasitic nematodes inhabit and become  important pest because they reduce the quality of the grass.  The pest problems on golf course can be indicated by its characteristics of nematode community.  Survey on nematodes community at PGS Golf Course Bandar Lampung was conducted from March to December 2004.  The objective was to study the characteristics of nematode community in the part of golf courses hole (green, collar, apron, and fairway).  Soil samples were taken from five holes each of it consists of green, collar, apron, and fairway, respectiveley.  Nematodes extraction was done in Laboratory of Arthropod Pest, Department of Plant Protection University of Lampung.   The result showed that at least 50 nematodes genera of 28 families inhabit PGS. The number of plant parasitic nematode genera was higher than the free-living one.  The characteristic of nematodes community on green and collar was different than on faiway. Nematode\r\nabundance and diversity on green and collar were higher than on fairway.  Based on abundance of nematode feeding group,\r\nmaturity index of free-living nematodes (MI) and that of plant parasitic nematodes (PPI), green and collar part seemed to be more favorable to plant parasitic nematodes than free-living nematodes. The contrary happened for fairway.  Four most dominant genera of plant parasitic nematodes on PGS golf course were Helicotylenchus, Hoplolaimus, Criconemella, and Xiphinema.   \r\n\r\nKey words: nematodes community, golf course",
