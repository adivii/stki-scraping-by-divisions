      "abstract": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe species of Verticillium associating with Hemileia vastatrix on coffee leaves.  H. vastarix is an obligate parasite on coffee plant and causes leaf rust that is considered as one of major problems in coffee production.  The plant pathogenic fungus was often to be antagonized by Verticillium of unknown species that could be developed as biocontrol agent.  The objective of this study was to identify and characterize Verticillium species associated with H. vastatrix on coffee leaves.  Leaf samples showing lesions with H. vastatrix uredospores and white mycelium were taken from two coffee fields at Sumberjaya Sub district, West Lampung, and transported in ice chest to the laboratory.  Verticillium was isolated with a sterilized needle and grown on PDA-L (PDA supplemented with lactic acid at 1.4 ml l-1).  Pure cultures were prepared by hyphal tip method and were kept on PDA slants.  For identification and characterization, cultures were grown on PDA-L for 2 weeks under transmitted light at room temperature.  Fungal structures were measured using micrometer under a microscope.  The average (range) length of phialids was 17 (16–18) µm.  The average (range) length and width of conidia were 5.5 (3–9) µm and 1.9 (1.5–2.0) µm, respectively.  Based on these and other morphological characteristics, the isolates were tentatively identified as Verticillium lecanii.  Three light conditions tested generally did not influence growth and reproduction of V. lecanii. \r\n\r\nKey words: Verticillium lecanii, Hemileia vastatrix, coffee leaf rust, mycoparasitism",

      "abstract": "In Indonesia a range of insecticides is routinely applied to control agromyzid leafminers. Insecticide applications can reduce parasitism by indigenous parasitoid wasps and also decrease numbers of the predatory muscid fly, Coenosia humilis, and these effects reduce control of leafminers. In replicated field trials, repeated applications of Profenofos were ineffective in controlling L. huidobrensis numbers on potatoes. Applications of Profenofos and Carbosulfan decreased rates of parasitism byHemiptarsenus varicornis and Opius chromatomyiae, and reduced numbers of C. humilis. These detrimental effects of the pesticides observed may have contributed to the increased damage and decreased yield in the pesticide-treated fields. An alternative control strategy involving the applications of Abamectin led to a reduction in leafminers without harmful effects on parasitoids and predators. Abamectin applications provide one potential component of an effective Liriomyza control strategy for Indonesian potato farmers.

It consists of sampling for macrofauna, nematodes and collembola, microbes, and soil physical-chemistry characteristics. With such a standardized method, the inventory results of BGBD should be comparable among regions, furthermore, the generalization of the trend for BGBG loss, as imposed by land use change from forest into agricultural lands, would be possible.  The sampling method in this book is originally designed for assessing various below-ground organisms simultaneously, i.e. for studying biodiversity in any given area.  Nevertheless, anyone who id interested in studying just one or two particular below-ground biota is hoped to find the book useful.",
