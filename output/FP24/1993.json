      "abstract": "Thirteen soybean plant introduction (PI) lines, selected for their apparent susceptibility to Heterodera glycines, were compared with cultivar Lee 74 as hosts of H. glycines races 1, 2, 3, and 4. Race 3 produced the highest average number of females of the four races. Compared to Lee 74, more (P = 0.05) females of H. glycines race 1 were extracted from eI 274420, PI 274423, and PI 317333; PI 86457 had more females of H. glycines race 2; and PI 86443, PI 86457, PI 261467, PI 274420, PI 274421, and PI 274423 had more females of H. glycines race 3. Similar numbers of females of H. glycines race 4 developed on all of the soybean lines and Lee 74. PI 274421, PI 274420, or PI 196159 could provide a more or equally susceptible host for H. glycines races 1, 2, 3, and 4 than Lee 74. One of these three lines could be substituted for Lee as the standard susceptible cultivar in the race determination test.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Glycine max, Heterodera glycines, nematode, race, soybean, soybean cyst nematode, susceptibility",
