Potential specificity between host varieties and pathogen isolates in the corn-southern leaf blight pathosystem was also exploited. Isolates of C. heterostrophus were collected from ecologically different parts of the country including the islands of Bali, Java, Sulawesi and Sumatera. Variations in morphological and pathogenic characteristics were observed among the isolates although possible host specificity was unlikely to exist between the corn varieties and fungal isolates tested. These results suggested that agricultural ecosystems might have affected morphological and pathological variations within Indonesian isolates of the fungus provided the existence of a common ancestor of the isolates.",

      "abstract": "Impact of Permethrin-Insecticide Application on Insect Pest (Thosea sp.) and Insect Pollinators (Elaeidobius\r\nkamerunicus) in Oil Palm Agroecosystem. Insecticide efficacy studies are usually determined from the target insect (pest)\r\ndata without regard to the effect of that treatment on the non-target insects (such as pollinators). This study examined the\r\neffect of permethrin (one of widely used insecticides for agriculture) on defoliating insect pest (nettle caterpillar, Thosea\r\nsp.) and insect pollinator (weevil, Elaeidobius kamerunicus) which lives on pollen of male oil palm flowers. A complete\r\nblock design was used in which each of four blocks consisted of 5 treatments (4 concentrations of permethrin; 50; 100;\r\n200; and 250 ppm and control) . The results clearly demonstrated that the application of permethrin reduced significantly\r\nthe number of nettle caterpillar throughout all sprayed plants (up to 100% 14 d after treatments). A significant difference\r\nin mean population of the caterpillar were detected between plots sprayed with permethrin (0.05; 0.25; 0.53; and 2.00\r\nlarvae\/leaves at concentrations of 250; 200; 100; and 50 ppm respectively) and control plant (5.2 larvae\/leaves) 3 d after\r\ntreatments. This insecticide effects persisted for at least 14 d after treatments. On the other hand, permethrin application\r\nin oil palm agroecosystem had adverse effects on main pollinator (E. kamerunicus). The number of weevil pollinators on\r\nsprayed plants (12.5; 59.3; 77.5; and 209.5 weevil\/male flower at concentrations of 50; 100; 200; and 250 ppm\r\nrespectively) were significantly fewer compared to the control plants (976.0 weevil\/male flower). The results indicate that,\r\ndespite high efficacy of permethrin in reducing number of insect pests of oil palm (Thosea sp.), its application also cause a\r\nsevere impact on important insect pollinators (E. kamerunicus).",
